                                            ECHO
Echo, a beautiful mountain nymph, was a great talker and always had to have the last word. 
She was a favorite of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Together they hunted in the woods, swam in 
mountain pools, and caught fish for meals. But Echo’s delightful life was destroyed, all because she 
tried to protect her friends from Hera’s wrath.
 One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that 
her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.
 Echo did not know which nymph was Zeus’s favorite, and so she started a conversation with 
Hera in order to let all the other nymphs escape.” Isn’t it lovely here?” she said. “Yes, indeed,” Hera 
replied, “but I am very busy right now and have no time for talk.”
 “It seems to me you are busy talking,” said Echo, “which is the nicest way to be busy, don’t 
you agree?” She went on and on, and every time Hera tried to get away from her, Echo asked another 
question. By the time Hera got away and ran to the nymphs’ pool, all the nymphs had fled. “This is your doing,” said Hera to Echo. “You kept talking to let them escape. And I shall 
punish you for that. You shall never be able to speak first, but shall only be able to repeat what others 
say. You shall always have the last word.”
 Soon after that, Echo fell in love with a handsome young hunter named Narcissus. She 
followed him through the woods, hoping to make him notice her. But she could not speak first and 
had to wait for him to speak to her.
 One day her chance came. Narcissus became separated from his friends and called out, 
“Is anyone here?” “Here,” called Echo. Narcissus could not see her, for she was behind a bush. He 
shouted, “Come,” thinking she was one of his companions, and she called back, “Come.”
 “Let us be together,” called Narcissus, for he could not see anybody. “Let us be together,” 
called Echo, and she ran up to him with her arms open, ready to embrace him. But Narcissus said 
cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.” “Have power 
over me,” said Echo pleadingly, but Narcissus bounded away, leaving Echo alone and ashamed. 
Afterward she lived in a cave, and finally, because of her great grief, she shrank to nothing. The only 
thing left of her was her voice, which echoed through the mountains, repeating the words of anyone 
who called.
1.The ancient Greeks believed that their gods acted like ordinary people and even experienced 
human emotions. Consider Hera’s feelings and actions in the highlighted part. In what ways is she 
like a human being? (highlighted part: Hera’s wrath.One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.)
2. Based in the highlighted part, it shows how Narcissus react to Echo. How is the highlighted 
part important in the story? (highlighted part: But Narcissus said cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.”)
3.This myth tell us about unrequited love. If you were Echo how would you handle the 
situation?
4.Some myths attempt to explain how something in the world came to be. What natural 
phenomenon is explained in this myth?
5. If you could change feelings or behavior of someone to be less like Echo or Narcissus, how 
would you change him/her?</a>

The one day I spent in Morocco, Africa was an experience of a lifetime. When I finally reached Morocco and got off the bus, there were four little girls standing shoeless in the hot sun. After I swallowed my tears, I could not even try to picture this in America as it is not something you often see in the U.S. Meanwhile my tourist guide instructed me not to give them money as it encouraged the children to beg; however, I was wearing four silver bracelets. 2. My father's name is Robert Chan, he died on Aug 28th, 2003 of a heart attack. It was about six in the morning I was sleeping restlessly, and the phone rang, and I missed it then it rang again. I saw it was my father's house calling to get me up for the first day of school. To my surprise it was my stepmother crying on the other line. This was the start of the worst day of my life in the short seventeen years I had been alive. 3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach. The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise, I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel relaxed and peaceful. When I want to relax in summer, I go to the beach. 4. As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that this had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud that you could not even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pegs, were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic, and black buckles. His riding pants were soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. 5. The much-advertised meteor shows this summer was a memory of behold. The air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in the darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy fog that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the moon shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view of twinkling stars.PS:Descriptive paragraph - describes a thing, a person, or a place. Narrative paragraph - tells a story or an event. (should be arrange chronologically-time order, that is in order in which they have happened) ​</a>

                                            What is the mood in the song called "All Too Well by Taylor Swift" ?
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</a>

                            5. ECHO
Echo, a beautiful mountain nymph, was a great talker and always had to have the last word. 
She was a favorite of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Together they hunted in the woods, swam in 
mountain pools, and caught fish for meals. But Echo’s delightful life was destroyed, all because she 
tried to protect her friends from Hera’s wrath.
 One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that 
her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.
 Echo did not know which nymph was Zeus’s favorite, and so she started a conversation with 
Hera in order to let all the other nymphs escape.” Isn’t it lovely here?” she said. “Yes, indeed,” Hera 
replied, “but I am very busy right now and have no time for talk.”
 “It seems to me you are busy talking,” said Echo, “which is the nicest way to be busy, don’t 
you agree?” She went on and on, and every time Hera tried to get away from her, Echo asked another 
question. By the time Hera got away and ran to the nymphs’ pool, all the nymphs had fled. “This is your doing,” said Hera to Echo. “You kept talking to let them escape. And I shall 
punish you for that. You shall never be able to speak first, but shall only be able to repeat what others 
say. You shall always have the last word.”
 Soon after that, Echo fell in love with a handsome young hunter named Narcissus. She 
followed him through the woods, hoping to make him notice her. But she could not speak first and 
had to wait for him to speak to her.
 One day her chance came. Narcissus became separated from his friends and called out, 
“Is anyone here?” “Here,” called Echo. Narcissus could not see her, for she was behind a bush. He 
shouted, “Come,” thinking she was one of his companions, and she called back, “Come.”
 “Let us be together,” called Narcissus, for he could not see anybody. “Let us be together,” 
called Echo, and she ran up to him with her arms open, ready to embrace him. But Narcissus said 
cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.” “Have power 
over me,” said Echo pleadingly, but Narcissus bounded away, leaving Echo alone and ashamed. 
Afterward she lived in a cave, and finally, because of her great grief, she shrank to nothing. The only 
thing left of her was her voice, which echoed through the mountains, repeating the words of anyone 
who called.
1.The ancient Greeks believed that their gods acted like ordinary people and even experienced 
human emotions. Consider Hera’s feelings and actions in the highlighted part. In what ways is she 
like a human being? (highlighted part: Hera’s wrath.One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.)
2. Based in the highlighted part, it shows how Narcissus react to Echo. How is the highlighted 
part important in the story? (highlighted part: But Narcissus said cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.”)
3.This myth tell us about unrequited love. If you were Echo how would you handle the 
situation?
4.Some myths attempt to explain how something in the world came to be. What natural 
phenomenon is explained in this myth?
5. If you could change feelings or behavior of someone to be less like Echo or Narcissus, how 
would you change him/her?</h2><br />

The one day I spent in Morocco, Africa was an experience of a lifetime. When I finally reached Morocco and got off the bus, there were four little girls standing shoeless in the hot sun. After I swallowed my tears, I could not even try to picture this in America as it is not something you often see in the U.S. Meanwhile my tourist guide instructed me not to give them money as it encouraged the children to beg; however, I was wearing four silver bracelets. 2. My father's name is Robert Chan, he died on Aug 28th, 2003 of a heart attack. It was about six in the morning I was sleeping restlessly, and the phone rang, and I missed it then it rang again. I saw it was my father's house calling to get me up for the first day of school. To my surprise it was my stepmother crying on the other line. This was the start of the worst day of my life in the short seventeen years I had been alive. 3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach. The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise, I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel relaxed and peaceful. When I want to relax in summer, I go to the beach. 4. As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that this had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud that you could not even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pegs, were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic, and black buckles. His riding pants were soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. 5. The much-advertised meteor shows this summer was a memory of behold. The air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in the darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy fog that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the moon shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view of twinkling stars.PS:Descriptive paragraph - describes a thing, a person, or a place.

                            28. What is the mood in the song called "All Too Well by Taylor Swift" ?
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</h2><br />
