                        The probability for an event to happen, P(x), can be computed by P(x) = number of favorable outcomes/number of possible outcomes.<br /><br />That being said, in this probllem our number of favorable outcomes is 2, having 2 T's in the problem.  And the number of possible outcomes is 10, having 10 letters in the word arithmetic.<br /><br />Thus, P(x) = 2/10 = 1/5 = 0.2 = 20%<br /><br />Hope this helps :)<br />p.s.

                            19. 39-44. Vincent has been absent due to sickness as contained in his parents' letter to you.

The sick student comes to class, was not able to obtain an admission slip from the Office of Students Affairs because the personnel in-charge was not there when the student went.

If the letter is legitimate and Vincent is indeed sick, I would consider allowing him to take the quiz, but with the understanding that he will have to obtain an admission slip from the Office of Students Affairs as soon as possible. This way, I am still following the school rule while also being understanding and accommodating the student's situation.</p><p></p><p>If I were the student in this situation, I would understand the school's rule and try to obtain an admission slip as soon as possible. If I was unable to obtain one because the personnel in-charge was not there, I would politely explain the situation to the teacher and ask if I could still take the quiz. I would also offer to bring in the admission slip as soon as it is available, to show that I am taking responsibility for my absence.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

They asked me if I wanted a dog or a cat and I instantly chose the latter. My father took me to a pet shop and my heart went pounding for this cute little white kitten with grey ears. We brought it home and since then it has been my best friend. I have named it Rosie.</p><p></p><p>Rosie is there with us since the last two years and has become a part of our family. I love playing with it. I play with it in the house and also take it out in the park every evening. I bathe it twice a month with the help of my mother.
