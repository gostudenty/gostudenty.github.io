                                            A U.S. project recently is building a massive website, "Native Bound-Unbound: Archive of Indigenous Americans Enslaved," to digitize and piece together stories of the millions of enslaved Native Americans, reported Axios. Native Americans' life has been tied to forced relocation, poverty, alcohol and high suicide rate. It is hard to imagine these words being associated with the United States, one of the world's most prosperous countries. What got these original masters of the land into such plight? And who should be responsible for their misfortune?</a>

The bird replied, "Yes, it is made of broken sticks, looks shabby and is open to the elements of nature. It is crude, but i built it, and i like it." "I guess it's just like any other nest, but not better than mine", said the tortoise. "You must be jealous of my shell, though." "On the contrary", the bird replied. "My home has space for my family and friends; your she'll cannot accommodate anyone other than you. Maybe you have a better house. But i have a better home", said the bird happily.1.Where Is the setting of the story? Consider geography, weather, time of day, social conditions, etc. Describe it.2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The plight of Native Americans in the United States is a complex and tragic history that has been shaped by a variety of factors, including forced relocation, poverty, and high rates of suicide. Many Native Americans have suffered greatly as a result of centuries of colonization, land theft, and cultural assimilation by European settlers and the U.S. government.</p><p></p><p>One of the key events in the history of Native Americans in the United States was the Indian Wars, which were fought between European settlers and Native American tribes from the late 16th century to the late 19th century. During this period, Native Americans were forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and relocated to reservations, which were often located in remote and barren areas. This process of forced relocation, known as the Indian removal policy, resulted in the deaths of thousands of Native Americans and the loss of much of their cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Indian Wars and forced relocation, Native Americans have also faced other challenges, including poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and high rates of substance abuse and suicide. These issues have been compounded by ongoing discrimination and marginalization, as Native Americans have often been excluded from mainstream society and denied equal opportunities.</p><br />

Beginning in the 16th century, European settlers began to colonize and settle in the Americas, pushing Native American tribes off their land and disrupting their traditional ways of life. The US government also implemented policies that forced Native Americans to relocate to designated reservations and assimilate into white American culture. These policies included the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which forcibly removed many Native American tribes from their ancestral lands in the southeastern United States, and the Indian boarding school system, which separated Native American children from their families and forced them to attend schools where they were not allowed to speak their native languages or practice their traditional cultures.</p><p></p><p>As a result of these policies, Native Americans experienced significant loss of land, resources, and cultural practices, and their populations were greatly reduced through violence and disease. Furthermore, they were subjected to poverty and underfunded reservation systems, where they were forced to live in often poor living conditions, lack of education and healthcare, and high rates of poverty, unemployment and alcoholism.</p><p></p><p>As for the responsibility, it is the result of actions taken by the US government and European settlers, The US government as well as the settlers, as they were the ones who implemented the policies and actions that led to the current plight of Native Americans.</p><p></p><p>It is important to acknowledge that the US government's actions were not only morally and legally wrong, but also were in a violation of the treaties it had made with the Indigenous nations. And even today, many Indigenous people still have to struggle for their rights and for their land claims, many cases go unresolved for decades.</p><p></p><p>Efforts such as the "Native Bound-Unbound: Archive of Indigenous Americans Enslaved" is an important step in preserving the stories of Indigenous people, highlighting their history and culture and informing the public about the ongoing struggle they faced and continue to face. And it's also an important step in recognizing and addressing the past wrongs and working towards reconciliation and reparations.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Carlo Abad</p><p>Summarize it</p><p></p><p>The plight of Native Americans is the result of a long history of colonization, forced displacement, and systematic oppression by European settlers and the US government, through forced relocations, policy of assimilation, violation of treaties and other forms of mistreatment.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The plight of Native Americans can be traced back to the arrival of Europeans in the Americas. Native Americans were subjected to forced relocation, exploitation, and violence at the hands of European colonizers, who sought to seize their land and resources. This led to a significant loss of life and cultural heritage for Native American communities.</p><p></p><p>In the United States, Native Americans were also subjected to policies of forced assimilation, in which they were pressured to adopt European-American ways of life and culture. This included the forced removal of Native American children from their families and communities and their placement in boarding schools, where they were forbidden to speak their own languages or practice their own customs.</p><p></p><p>It is clear that the actions of European colonizers and the policies of the United States government played a significant role in the plight of Native Americans. These actions and policies resulted in the loss of land, cultural heritage, and the well-being of Native American communities. It is important to recognize the role that these actions and policies played in the current challenges faced by Native Americans and to work towards addressing and rectifying these issues.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The plight of Native Americans began with the arrival of Europeans in the 15th century. The Europeans brought with them diseases for which the Native Americans had no immunity, leading to the death of millions. They also brought superior weapons, which allowed them to conquer vast territories. Eventually, the Europeans began to actively push the Native Americans out of their lands, often through violence and warfare.</p><p></p><p>In addition to being forced off their land, many Native Americans were also forced into slavery. This was especially true in the South, where Native Americans were often used as laborers on plantations. The U.S. government also enacted policies that forced Native Americans to sign away their land rights, which made them even more vulnerable to exploitation.</p><p></p><p>The U.S. government is ultimately responsible for the plight of Native Americans. The government sanctioned policies that led to the forced relocation, exploitation, and dispossession of Native Americans. The government also failed to provide adequate protection for Native Americans against the violence and exploitation of European settlers. Despite the fact that Native Americans have been subjected to some of the most egregious human rights violations in history, the U.S. government has failed to properly acknowledge and address the wrongs committed against them</p><br />

Magnitude uses a "Ricther Scale" to define the total size of the earthquake or Crustal plates. Intensity is always written in Roman Numerals. For Example: I, II, III, IV, and etc.                     Intensity Scale in Romal Numerals <p>I - 1 = Scarcely Preceptible</p><p>II - 2 = Slightly Felt</p><p>III - 3 = Weak</p><p>IV - 4 = Moderately Strong</p><p>V - 5 = Strong</p><p>VI - 6 = Very Strong</p><p>VII - 7 = Destructive</p><p>VIII - 8 = Very Destructive</p><p>IX - 9 = Devastating</p><p>X - 10 = Completely Devastating</p>Reading Materials for Earthquake

                            19. A U.S. project recently is building a massive website, "Native Bound-Unbound: Archive of Indigenous Americans Enslaved," to digitize and piece together stories of the millions of enslaved Native Americans, reported Axios. Native Americans' life has been tied to forced relocation, poverty, alcohol and high suicide rate. It is hard to imagine these words being associated with the United States, one of the world's most prosperous countries. What got these original masters of the land into such plight? And who should be responsible for their misfortune?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The plight of Native Americans can be traced back to the arrival of European colonizers in the Americas. The colonizers brought with them diseases to which the Indigenous population had no immunity, leading to the deaths of millions. Additionally, the colonizers brought new technologies, weapons, and ways of life that threatened the traditional way of life of Native Americans.</p><p></p><p>The colonizers also sought to take control of the land, resources, and labor of the Indigenous peoples. This often involved forced relocation of Native American communities, displacement from their ancestral lands, and the imposition of treaties and policies that stripped them of their autonomy and rights.</p><p></p><p>The forced enslavement of Native Americans also played a significant role in their plight. Many Indigenous people were enslaved by European colonizers and forced to work on farms, plantations, and mines.</p><p></p><p>The United States government, as well as European colonizers and later on settlers, are responsible for the forced relocation, forced labor, and systemic oppression of Native Americans. It is a dark chapter in the history of the United States, and it's important that we acknowledge and learn from it in order to work towards reconciliation and justice for Native Americans today.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

And who should be responsible for their misfortune?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Native Americans have a long and complex history in the United States, including experiences of forced relocation, poverty, and other challenges. One of the main reasons for the plight of Native Americans is the history of colonization and displacement that they have experienced. European colonizers who arrived in North America in the 16th and 17th centuries brought with them diseases that decimated Native American populations, and also pursued policies of forced removal and assimilation that aimed to strip Native Americans of their lands, cultures, and traditions.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these historical factors, Native Americans have also faced ongoing challenges related to poverty, alcohol abuse, and high rates of suicide. These challenges are often the result of ongoing systemic discrimination and marginalization, as well as the intergenerational effects of trauma that many Native American communities have experienced.</p><p></p><p>It is important to recognize that the plight of Native Americans is not simply a matter of individual misfortune, but rather the result of a long and complex history of policies and actions that have had a profound impact on Native American communities. As such, responsibility for addressing these challenges lies with all of us, as a society, to work towards creating a more equitable and just future for Native Americans.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

It is made of broken twigs, it has no roof, and looks crude. What's worse is that you had to build it yourself. I think my house, which is my shell, is much better than you pathetic nest". The bird replied, "Yes, it is made of broken sticks, looks shabby and is open to the elements of nature. It is crude, but i built it, and i like it." "I guess it's just like any other nest, but not better than mine", said the tortoise. "You must be jealous of my shell, though." "On the contrary", the bird replied. "My home has space for my family and friends; your she'll cannot accommodate anyone other than you. Maybe you have a better house. But i have a better home", said the bird happily.1.Where Is the setting of the story? Consider geography, weather, time of day, social conditions, etc. Describe it.2.
