The first kikuyu was called kikuyo and live in a village called kikuyu, which is still there. The word kuyu means a "fig" and kikuyu is a fig-tree, a fertility symbol in africa as will as in asia kikuyu had nine daughters, who become the ancestral mothers of the nine major clans of the kikuyu nation. The kikuyu word for God is Ngai, which means the Apportioner . Thus during creation, God appirtioned his gifts to all the nations of the earth. To the kikuyus he gave the knowladge of and the tools for, agriculture, at which the kikuyus have always excelled.

Ang unang kikuyu ay tinawag na kikuyo at naninirahan sa isang nayon na tinatawag na kikuyu, na naroon pa rin. Ang salitang kuyu ay nangangahulugang isang "fig" at kikuyu ay puno ng igos, isang simbolong pagkamayabong sa africa gaya ng sa asya kikuyu ay may siyam na anak na babae, na naging mga ninuno ng mga siyam na pangunahing pamilya ng kikuyu bansa. Ang kikuyu salita para sa Diyos ay Ngai, na nangangahulugang ang Apportioner. Kaya sa panahon ng paglikha, ipinakita ng Diyos ang kanyang mga regalo sa lahat ng mga bansa sa mundo. Sa kikuyus ibinigay niya ang kaalaman at mga kasangkapan para sa, agrikultura, kung saan ang kikuyus ay palaging pinupuri. Kinokontrol ng Diyos ang rian at ang kulog, kung saan ang mga nag-uutos ng mga manggagawa ng kasamaan kapag kinakailangan, ang bawat tao ay may espiritu ngoma, na pagkamatay pagkatapos ay nagiging isang multo.<br />
