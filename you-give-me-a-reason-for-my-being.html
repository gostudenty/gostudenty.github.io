                                            What can I use as a title for this?
Back in the old days, being alone was fun because no one was going to bother you and you can do whatever you want. Also, you can focus on your studies but when I grew up, it changed me from being alone. I knew that it is dangerous because it is addicting once you see how peaceful it is like you do not want to deal with other people anymore. 
I want to elaborate on my statement that being alone is dangerous and addictive because based on my experience when I was the only child before my parents do not allow me to play outside they just let me play around the house, study, and sleep that’s all I do every day. So when I was in grade 1 my classmate was bullying me my teacher found out because I run towards her what she did was call our parent and let them know that his son was bullying me after that I sat inside the classroom alone I did what I did was reading books and dictionaries sometimes I also sat outside in a little house which we call the reading area. I hate talking to everyone when I started to experience bullying it’s not just that happens there’s a lot more reason why I do not want to talk to them even to my family and classmates but I like to talk with my cousins. I knew that when you have those experiences from being alone it’s so hard to give trust and get close to them that is why it is dangerous and addictive to be alone because all the people surround you have so many things to say and judge you even though I want to feel happy but I just want to avoid it but until I graduated from grade school I thought I’m not going to get bully again it happens many times that is why I just want to be alone forever.
When I started going to high school I observe all my classmates and I think they’re not like the people I met before grade school feels that I want to have friends now and get to know them so I give my trust to them and I started to like to be with my friends everywhere we go and do nothing to their house just having a food trip and karaoke. It is also started for becoming a rebel we are sometimes do not go to school we went to our friend’s house or go somewhere else and get drunk like if you get drunk I feel I’m the happiest person it makes me forget everything my problem, and for being alone because I have my friends but whenever I’m with them it’s like your being rebellious because you’re not listening to your family anymore it’s like you have your own world and alone again. My friends now are gone I have only one friend now which is not like my friends before she is giving me good advice and she made me realize what is better for me to do. Now I’m overthinking too much because I realize that all I do is regret all my past decisions. The fact that you are not living your life fully enough and for addicting, you cannot control or stop yourself from being alone and scared to be alone you are still going to find another way to not be alone if I did not control it maybe because it will become your habit.
To sum up, don’t be alone for a long time do not be scared to give trust and hang out with people around you because not all the people that you will get to know will not going to bully, a bad influence sometimes they’re people that will motivate you, cheer you up, accept you from who you are and loved you in deep.

                                            The Story of the PotterRakal was the name of a poor potter who lived in a certain kingdom.One night, when he was returning after drinking more than he should, he stumbled and fell over some pots. When he got up, he saw blood was oozing out of his forehead. There was a deep cut due to a broken piece of pot.Poor that he was, he did not go apply any medicine on his wound, which is the reason that the wound did not heal for a long time. After a long time, the wound finally healed by itself, but it left a big scar on his forehead.Soon afterwards, there was a famine in the country, and he decided to leave ha place and travel to another part of the country. On his way, he joined a caravan of desert travelers who served at the royal household. Along with them, he started serving at the royal household.One day, the king noticed the big scar on his forehead and thought, "This man must be a great warrior. The scar on his forehead is evident that he hasreceived such wound in some battle. He must be very brave."Thus, the king promoted Rakal as a warrior and he was honored with a place amongst the best warriors of the kingdom.The other household workers knew that he was no warrior, and became jealous of the fact that the king favored him, although he did not deserve it rightly.Soon after, a battle was impending and the king summoned all his troops. He wanted to speak to his army of soldiers personally and gift them with precious tems as an encouragement. The king addressed the soldiers with encouraging words and inspected their equipment, weapons, and even the elephants and horses.On the other hand, Rakal, the potter, was no real warrior. He feared going into the battleground. All the preparations for battle made him tense. But he was resolved to prove himself as a warrior in the battleground.While inspecting, the king noticed him. He took him aside and asked, "O Wamor, fighting which battle did you get this deadly scar?"The potter replied, "O king, this scar was not caused by any wound by any word. Being a potter by profession myself, my home was full of pots. One night, I tripped after drinking more than I should have, I tripped over them that caused this wound. Due to improper attention, the wound left this big scar."When the king heard the truth, he felt embarrassed for his earlier decision. He asked his soldiers, "He is a potter, who has deceived me by pretending to be a warrior. Drive him away from the army?"The potter fell on his knees, and pleaded to the king, "O King, please do not do this. Have mercy on me, for I am sure I will be able to prove my bravery on the battleground. Please give me a chance to prove my worth."The king replied, "You may have excellent qualities, and you may be brave. But you do not possess the qualities required on the battleground. When the other warriors will come to know that you are only a potter, they will ridicule you. You will get yourself killed on the battleground! It is better if you leave and return to your home."The potter understood the king's advice, and left the palace immediately.While Rakal was walking away, the king said, "Continue being what you are or else you will pay dearly for it."Questions:1. how did rakal get his scar on his forehead?2. how was he able to enter the royal household of the king?3. how did the king know that rachal was not really a warrior?4. what did the king do after learning the truth about rakal?5. what is the moral lesson of the story?Good answer - BrainliestNonsense Answer/ Bad explanation - Report​</a>

                                            Activity E. Read the viewpoints of Person A and Person B then tell with whom do you
agree and why by completing the statements that follow.
PERSON A: I enjoy smoking. It gives me great pleasure and helps me deal with my
everyday stress. There may be health risks involved, but even so it's my choice to
disregard them for the time being. I'm an adult, I pay for my cigarettes myself, and
smoking them is entirely legal. So, as long as I take reasonable steps not to bother
others, I should be able to smoke anywhere and anytime I want.
                                     PERSON B: If someone wishes to smoke, or do anything else for that matter, in
an entirely private setting, where his actions cannot affect anyone else all, he
may do so of course. But we don't live our lives in a vacuum. Whatever he does
publicly is no longer a private affair. In addition to the nuisance brought about by
the smoke and smell. It is also well-known that second-hand smoke is even more
dangerous than first-hand smoke., so non-smokers are affected even more
than smokers! So I have the right to protect myself from a smoker's threat to my
life.
                                                           I agree with Person

THE THIRD INPORTANCE OF RELIGION IN MY LIFE IS, RELIGION IN MY LIFE IS, RELIGION PROMOTES SOCIAL SOLIDARITY. RELIGION GIVES THE SPIRIT OF BROTHERHOOD. WITH PROMISES AND COMMANDMENTS ABOUT DOING GOOD TO EVERY PERSON WE MEET,  WE HAVE THE INCREDIBLE BIG BUT AMAZING TASK OR BEING PEOPLE OF TRUST TO OTHERS. THE FOURTH IMPORTANCE ROLE OF THE RELIGION IN MY LIFE IS RELIGION INFLUENCES OUR HEALTH. THERE ARE TWI THINGS IN RELIGION THAT HELP TO INFLUENCE ONE'S HEALTH, AND THIS IS PRAYER AND MEDITATION. WHEN YOU PRAY AND MEDITATE YOU ACTIVATE THE BRAIN AND STIMULATE CLARITY AS YOU DO YOUR THINKING. RELIGION IS HELPFUL IN A HUMAN BEING BECAUSE IT ENABLES HER TO MEMORIZE THINGS. RELIGION IN OUR LIVES HAS THE ROLE OF CLEARING OUR MINDS AND PROMOTING OUR WELL-BEING. THE LAST IMPORTANCE ROLE IS RELIGION GIVES ME SENSE OF PURPOSE. RELIGION HELPS US TO DEFINE OUR LIVES, AND THUS WE CAN SAY IT GIVES MEANING TO OUR LIVES. RELIGION HELPS US TO DEAL WITH THE MOST STRESSFUL MOMENTS OF OUR LIVES BECAUSE IT GIVES US HOPE TO MOVE ON. IT ENABLES YOU TO AVOID DEPRESSION, AND SO YOUR LIFE MOVES MORE SMMOOTHLY AND IN A HEALTHY MANNER.

                                            identify whether the speech below is memorized, extemporaneous or impromptu.1. My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</a>

                                            Emma Watson's Speech on Gender Equality at the UN(an excerpt)"I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women 6 months ago. The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women’s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.When I was 8, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on for our parents. When at 14, I started to be sexualized by certain elements of  the media. At 15, my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they  didn’t want to appear masculine. At 18, my male friends were unable to express their feelings. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, [women’s expression is] seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, and anti-men, unattractive even…Men, I would like to give this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date, I’ve seen my father’s role as a parent being valued less by society. I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. In fact, in the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and heart disease. I’ve seen men fragile and insecure by what constitutes male success. Men don’t have the benefits of equality, either... If you believe in equality, you might be one of the inadvertent feminists I spoke of earlier and for this I applaud you. We must strive for a united world but the good news is we have a platform. It is called HeForShe. I invite you to step forward, to be seen and I ask yourself: if not me, who? If not now, when? Thank you."SHARING YOUR VIEWS. Based on the excerpt that you have read from activity 2, share your views on the following questions: 1. What part of the excerpt do you agree? Give reasons.2.

                                            In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

                            7. What can I use as a title for this?
Back in the old days, being alone was fun because no one was going to bother you and you can do whatever you want. Also, you can focus on your studies but when I grew up, it changed me from being alone. I knew that it is dangerous because it is addicting once you see how peaceful it is like you do not want to deal with other people anymore. 
I want to elaborate on my statement that being alone is dangerous and addictive because based on my experience when I was the only child before my parents do not allow me to play outside they just let me play around the house, study, and sleep that’s all I do every day. So when I was in grade 1 my classmate was bullying me my teacher found out because I run towards her what she did was call our parent and let them know that his son was bullying me after that I sat inside the classroom alone I did what I did was reading books and dictionaries sometimes I also sat outside in a little house which we call the reading area. I hate talking to everyone when I started to experience bullying it’s not just that happens there’s a lot more reason why I do not want to talk to them even to my family and classmates but I like to talk with my cousins. I knew that when you have those experiences from being alone it’s so hard to give trust and get close to them that is why it is dangerous and addictive to be alone because all the people surround you have so many things to say and judge you even though I want to feel happy but I just want to avoid it but until I graduated from grade school I thought I’m not going to get bully again it happens many times that is why I just want to be alone forever.
When I started going to high school I observe all my classmates and I think they’re not like the people I met before grade school feels that I want to have friends now and get to know them so I give my trust to them and I started to like to be with my friends everywhere we go and do nothing to their house just having a food trip and karaoke. It is also started for becoming a rebel we are sometimes do not go to school we went to our friend’s house or go somewhere else and get drunk like if you get drunk I feel I’m the happiest person it makes me forget everything my problem, and for being alone because I have my friends but whenever I’m with them it’s like your being rebellious because you’re not listening to your family anymore it’s like you have your own world and alone again. My friends now are gone I have only one friend now which is not like my friends before she is giving me good advice and she made me realize what is better for me to do. Now I’m overthinking too much because I realize that all I do is regret all my past decisions. The fact that you are not living your life fully enough and for addicting, you cannot control or stop yourself from being alone and scared to be alone you are still going to find another way to not be alone if I did not control it maybe because it will become your habit.
To sum up, don’t be alone for a long time do not be scared to give trust and hang out with people around you because not all the people that you will get to know will not going to bully, a bad influence sometimes they’re people that will motivate you, cheer you up, accept you from who you are and loved you in deep. You should socialize explore everything try out new things, get out of your comfort zone, give your trust, and share your feelings or thoughts with your cousins because you can trust them so you will not be alone anymore.</h2><br />

                            10. The Story of the PotterRakal was the name of a poor potter who lived in a certain kingdom.One night, when he was returning after drinking more than he should, he stumbled and fell over some pots. When he got up, he saw blood was oozing out of his forehead. There was a deep cut due to a broken piece of pot.Poor that he was, he did not go apply any medicine on his wound, which is the reason that the wound did not heal for a long time. After a long time, the wound finally healed by itself, but it left a big scar on his forehead.Soon afterwards, there was a famine in the country, and he decided to leave ha place and travel to another part of the country. On his way, he joined a caravan of desert travelers who served at the royal household. Along with them, he started serving at the royal household.One day, the king noticed the big scar on his forehead and thought, "This man must be a great warrior. The scar on his forehead is evident that he hasreceived such wound in some battle. He must be very brave."Thus, the king promoted Rakal as a warrior and he was honored with a place amongst the best warriors of the kingdom.The other household workers knew that he was no warrior, and became jealous of the fact that the king favored him, although he did not deserve it rightly.Soon after, a battle was impending and the king summoned all his troops. He wanted to speak to his army of soldiers personally and gift them with precious tems as an encouragement. The king addressed the soldiers with encouraging words and inspected their equipment, weapons, and even the elephants and horses.On the other hand, Rakal, the potter, was no real warrior. He feared going into the battleground. All the preparations for battle made him tense. But he was resolved to prove himself as a warrior in the battleground.While inspecting, the king noticed him. He took him aside and asked, "O Wamor, fighting which battle did you get this deadly scar?"The potter replied, "O king, this scar was not caused by any wound by any word. Being a potter by profession myself, my home was full of pots. One night, I tripped after drinking more than I should have, I tripped over them that caused this wound. Due to improper attention, the wound left this big scar."When the king heard the truth, he felt embarrassed for his earlier decision. He asked his soldiers, "He is a potter, who has deceived me by pretending to be a warrior. Drive him away from the army?"The potter fell on his knees, and pleaded to the king, "O King, please do not do this. Have mercy on me, for I am sure I will be able to prove my bravery on the battleground. Please give me a chance to prove my worth."The king replied, "You may have excellent qualities, and you may be brave. But you do not possess the qualities required on the battleground. When the other warriors will come to know that you are only a potter, they will ridicule you. You will get yourself killed on the battleground! It is better if you leave and return to your home."The potter understood the king's advice, and left the palace immediately.While Rakal was walking away, the king said, "Continue being what you are or else you will pay dearly for it."Questions:1. how did rakal get his scar on his forehead?2. how was he able to enter the royal household of the king?3. how did the king know that rachal was not really a warrior?4. what did the king do after learning the truth about rakal?5. what is the moral lesson of the story?Good answer - BrainliestNonsense Answer/ Bad explanation - Report​</h2><br />

                            17. Activity E. Read the viewpoints of Person A and Person B then tell with whom do you
agree and why by completing the statements that follow.
PERSON A: I enjoy smoking. It gives me great pleasure and helps me deal with my
everyday stress. There may be health risks involved, but even so it's my choice to
disregard them for the time being. I'm an adult, I pay for my cigarettes myself, and
smoking them is entirely legal. So, as long as I take reasonable steps not to bother
others, I should be able to smoke anywhere and anytime I want.
                                     PERSON B: If someone wishes to smoke, or do anything else for that matter, in
an entirely private setting, where his actions cannot affect anyone else all, he
may do so of course. But we don't live our lives in a vacuum. Whatever he does
publicly is no longer a private affair. In addition to the nuisance brought about by
the smoke and smell. It is also well-known that second-hand smoke is even more
dangerous than first-hand smoke., so non-smokers are affected even more
than smokers! So I have the right to protect myself from a smoker's threat to my
life.
                                                           I agree with Person

My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2.

As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4.

It is the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.When I was 8, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on for our parents. When at 14, I started to be sexualized by certain elements of  the media. At 15, my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they  didn’t want to appear masculine. At 18, my male friends were unable to express their feelings. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me.

Apparently, [women’s expression is] seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, and anti-men, unattractive even…Men, I would like to give this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date, I’ve seen my father’s role as a parent being valued less by society. I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. In fact, in the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and heart disease. I’ve seen men fragile and insecure by what constitutes male success.

                            28. In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'
