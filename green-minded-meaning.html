                        <strong>CONNOTATION </strong><strong>AND </strong><strong>DENOTATION</strong><p><strong>I</strong>. <strong>A</strong>. <strong>Direction</strong>: <strong>Identify the meaning of words if it is a connotation, write C, and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>D</strong><strong> if it is a denotation</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>»</strong><strong> </strong><strong>1.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Green</strong></p>C  Lino is not a good boy, many of his classmate don't want him in their groupHe is green minded..D  Mommy, please buy me a green apple.<p></p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong><p>a. It was at a specific meaning ang illustration of the word "green". <strong>Though as originally defined as a secondary colour.</strong> Hence, <strong>Denotation</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>b. Even though the statement utilized the word "green", the way the sentence is using it gives off a different meaning. Hence, <strong>Connotation</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>»</strong><strong> </strong><strong>2.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Snake</strong></p>D  Lito saw a big snake in their backyardC  Mario is a snake. He pretends to be a good boy. He guide his friends thingsbut when they were not around, he get something in their bags.<p></p>EXPLANATION<p>a. The word "snake" was used by its' <strong>original</strong> <strong>meaning</strong>. <strong>It wasn't expressed to show an expression or characterization on a subject, </strong>neither to anything. Hence, <strong>Denotation</strong>.</p><p></p><p>b. On the other hand, <strong>the word "snake" was used to describe the subject's characteristics.</strong> Hence, <strong>Connotation</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>»</strong><strong> </strong><strong>3.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Cool</strong></p>D  The weather is very cool.C  I like your haircut, it is very cool.<p></p><p></p>EXPLANATION<p>a. The word "cool" was used <strong>appropriately and as the concept of the original meaning was used in a sensible way</strong> throughout the demonstrative sentence. Hence, <strong>Denotation</strong></p><p></p><p>b. Even though it may seem as it shouldn't be Connotation, <strong>it is because cool means "calming, chilled, or warm" and as used in describing in a Connotative way. </strong>Hence, <strong>Connotation</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>»</strong><strong> </strong><strong>4.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Cheap</strong></p>C  Linda goes with different man that's why she is being called cheapD  The dress in the store is cheap.<p></p><p></p>EXPLANATION<p>a. <strong>Some words can use its' dennotative meaning to illustrate it to be abusive to people. </strong>Example of the statement I am referring to. Cheap means "a cost that doesn't cost much" can also be abusive to make it mean. Hence, <strong>C</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong></p><p></p><p>b. The word "cheap' is used correctly and appropriately on the given statement because there are cheap dress which describes that it has a low cost. Hence, <strong>D</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong> </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>»</strong><strong> </strong><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>R</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>s</strong></p>D Rats lived in a dark placesC Rats! I left my pocket book in the car<p></p>EXPLANATION<p>a. This was based on the mammal rats, (which is the correct meaning) that said lived in dark places. It wasn't used for any expression on a subject, characteristic, or emotion. Hence, <strong>D</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p>b. <strong>It sounded as though they used the word "Rats" to give emotion to the statement. </strong>It <strong>didn't</strong> give any <strong>facts</strong> or <strong>predicate</strong> <strong>based</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>word</strong> <strong>rats</strong> when it was used. Hence, <strong>C</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>-</strong></p>Word used as an expression, emotion, or a characteristic on a subject.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>We’ve cooked rice countless times and countless ways, but we still don’t always get it right. We’ve rinsed it, soaked it, simmered it in carefully measured liquid, and boiled it in a large pot of water. We’ve cooked it with and without a lid, tried all shapes and sizes of pans, and even invested in specially designed rice cookers. Sometimes each grain is tender yet chewy, separate, and fluffy. Other times, the grains just clump together.<p></p>So how do we get our rice to behave and turn out exactly how we want it? Well, we’ve found the secret. Cooking rice perfectly is simply a matter of choosing the right variety and the right cooking method for the type of dish you want to make. It’s not rocket science, just a simple application of rice science.<br />
