                                            Travel offers you to offer a chance to enjoy life .You can meet fascinating people and experience  interesting cultures.I know some of us are doing some activities to prevent boredom  especially we  are facing the Corona Virus.Also I know that you really want to travel now but because of pandemic you cant,so im going to tour you in our municipality.Bantay Bell tower is one we are proud of not only because of its historical and cultural significance but also because of its commanding view of Vigan from the highest portion of it that can be climbed . It was said to be the people’s watchtower, part of the city’s defense that helps in alerting it against possible enemies. It was built in 1591.In my experience this belfry will like take you to you to the past and experience the breath taking view There is also one place here in our beloved Bantay that is also good for instagram because of its natural beauty and this is the Bicential Park of Bantay.This place was visited by some teenagers because its very relaxing and good for dating and bonding with family.I also go here and i can say that the view,the nature and the peacefulness was really incredible.This park was really good for those who want to relax and foget their problem for a meantime.This park was open for 5 am to 9 pm.And if youre hungry or thirsty theres some store that sells snacks and drinks. Bantay was one of the sources of rice because we are surrounded by farmland and my grandfather was also a farmer and im very proud of that,without them theres no rice we are eating right now.Twenty years from now you will be more dissapointed by the things you didn't do by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines .Catch the trade winds in your sails.Explore,Dream,Discover and be with our relaxing municality. Also I want to tell you this "Dont wanna sleep, don't wanna die,just wanna go travellin through the pastures of the sky.patulong itranslate sa tagalog please^_^​</a>

Brieflydescribe its (a) recency, (b) objectivity, (c) relevance and (d) conciseness. Do it onyour notebook.Review of Related Literature on Language and its Sustainabilityin the Teaching and Learning Process (Excerpt)Eugene Ray F Santos, MATWith the major premise to bring higher literacy among younger children,learners are being taught using their mother-tongue in their primary educationalongside with "Tagalog" which is the most common variety of the nationallanguage of the country. This is in consonance with the findings of variousstudies on bilingualism. McCabe et al., (2013) found a reasonable basis from thegrowing population of bilinguals in the world to affirm that learning using twolanguages does not lead to confusion or difficulty in an academic environment.The mentioned studies zoom in the starting phase of languagedevelopment wherein most factors that affect language learning are externallyproduced or the physical language environment. It can be pointed out that thesituation where a learner is raised and the people who surround him havebearing in the failure or success of language acquisition, training, and learning.Considering these factors beyond the school, the actual teaching-learningenvironment, language teachers indeed have a very serious job to work out.It is undeniable that there is voluminous input available about languageteaching and learning. However, making language learning effective and efficient,considering learners' diversity, personality, behavior, intelligence and otherequally important factorsfactors still remains quite challenging for languageprofessionalsPIVOT 4A CALABARZON23​</a>

Travel offers you to offer a chance to enjoy life .You can meet fascinating people and experience  interesting cultures.I know some of us are doing some activities to prevent boredom  especially we  are facing the Corona Virus.Also I know that you really want to travel now but because of pandemic you cant,so im going to tour you in our municipality.Bantay Bell tower is one we are proud of not only because of its historical and cultural significance but also because of its commanding view of Vigan from the highest portion of it that can be climbed . It was said to be the people’s watchtower, part of the city’s defense that helps in alerting it against possible enemies. It was built in 1591.In my experience this belfry will like take you to you to the past and experience the breath taking view There is also one place here in our beloved Bantay that is also good for instagram because of its natural beauty and this is the Bicential Park of Bantay.This place was visited by some teenagers because its very relaxing and good for dating and bonding with family.I also go here and i can say that the view,the nature and the peacefulness was really incredible.This park was really good for those who want to relax and foget their problem for a meantime.This park was open for 5 am to 9 pm.And if youre hungry or thirsty theres some store that sells snacks and drinks. Bantay was one of the sources of rice because we are surrounded by farmland and my grandfather was also a farmer and im very proud of that,without them theres no rice we are eating right now.Twenty years from now you will be more dissapointed by the things you didn't do by the ones you did do.

This is in consonance with the findings of variousstudies on bilingualism. McCabe et al., (2013) found a reasonable basis from thegrowing population of bilinguals in the world to affirm that learning using twolanguages does not lead to confusion or difficulty in an academic environment.The mentioned studies zoom in the starting phase of languagedevelopment wherein most factors that affect language learning are externallyproduced or the physical language environment. It can be pointed out that thesituation where a learner is raised and the people who surround him havebearing in the failure or success of language acquisition, training, and learning.Considering these factors beyond the school, the actual teaching-learningenvironment, language teachers indeed have a very serious job to work out.It is undeniable that there is voluminous input available about languageteaching and learning.
