Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember The people we used to be It's even harder to picture That you're not here next to me You say it's too late to make it But is it too late to try? And in our time that you wasted All of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time, when we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone, trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this All those fairy tales are full of s One more f love song, I'll be sick Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow 'Cause you forgot yesterday I gave you my love to borrow But you just gave it away You can't expect me to be fine I don't expect you to care I know I've said it before But all of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time When we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this And all those fairy tales are full of s One more f love song, I'll be sick Now I'm at a payphone Man, f that s I'll be out spending all this money While you sitting 'round wondering Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing Made it from the bottom Now, when you see me I'm stunning And all of my cars start with a push of a button Telling me had chances I blew up Or whatever you call it Switch the number to my phone So you never could call it Don't need my name on my show You can tell that I'm balling Swish, what a shame could have got picked Had a really good game But you missed your last shot So you talk about who you see at the top Or what you could have saw But sad to say it's over for Phantom pulled up valet open doors Wished I'd go away Got what you was looking for Now it's me who they want So you can go and take that Little piece of s with you I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this All these fairy tales are full of s Yeah, one more f love song, I'll be sick Now I'm at a payphone ​</a>

BOHOLANO LYRIC POEM
From Region VII
And in the midst of these gem-like Islands,
Is one more blessed with singular beauty,
Gowned in the green of emeralds,
Skirted by beaches of alabaster sands,
And crowned in splendor by deep-blue 
heights.
Others call her Paradise,
But the natives of the place call her,
Bohol . . .
This is Bohol . . .
Land of the endless charms, mystery and

Magellan
By Yoyoy Villame
On March 16, 1521
When Philippines was discovered by 
Magellan
They were sailing day and night across 
the big ocean
Until they saw a small Limasawa island
Magellan landed in Limasawa at noon
The people met him very welcome on the 
shore
They did not understand the speaking 
they have done
Because Kastila gid at Waray-Waray 
man
When Magellan landed in Cebu City
Rajah Humabon met him, they were very 
happy
All people were baptized and built the 
church of Christ
And that’s the beginning of our Catholic 
life
When Magellan visited in Mactan
To christianize them everyone
But Lapu-Lapu met him on the shore
and drive Magellan to go back home
Then Magellan got so mad
Ordered his men to camouflage
“Mactan island we could not grab
‘Cause Lapu Lapu is very hard”
Then the battle began at dawn
Bolos and spears versus guns and
cannons
When Magellan was hit on his neck
He stumble down and cried and cried

                                            What I Need to Know Before we explore the music of the Lumon Lowlands, let us first recall the different musical elements that you have learned in your previous music lessons The first element is Rhythm. Rhythm is the regular repeated pametne sounds. It serves as the pulse of the musical composition. This element has three components beat, tempo and meter. Do you think you can identify these components in a certain music while listening to it? Have you experienced nodding your head or tapping your foot every time you hear music? If so, you are actua feeling the beat of the music. In singing your favorite videoke tune, you are actually singing the rhythm because of the different note durations of the lyrics of the song Tempo is the speed of the beat. Every music has its own speed which depends on the mood of the whole music. Most happy tunes are fast while sed music is relatively slow The meter, which composes of time signature is the combination of strong beats (accent) and weak beats For example four four time signature is like counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. This type of meter is commonly used in pop songs. In time , signature, you just count 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 and so on. This meter is commonls used in waltz music. For the time signature two four), you just count 1, 2.1, 2.1. 2 and so on. Marches, polkas use this kind of meter. 2​</a>

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember The people we used to be It's even harder to picture That you're not here next to me You say it's too late to make it But is it too late to try? And in our time that you wasted All of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time, when we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone, trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this All those fairy tales are full of s One more f love song, I'll be sick Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow 'Cause you forgot yesterday I gave you my love to borrow But you just gave it away You can't expect me to be fine I don't expect you to care I know I've said it before But all of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time When we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone?

BOHOLANO LYRIC POEM
From Region VII
And in the midst of these gem-like Islands,
Is one more blessed with singular beauty,
Gowned in the green of emeralds,
Skirted by beaches of alabaster sands,
And crowned in splendor by deep-blue 
heights.
Others call her Paradise,
But the natives of the place call her,
Bohol . . .
This is Bohol . . .
Land of the endless charms, mystery and 
the 
Perpetual sun; land of the cone-shaped
Chocolate Hills, of verdant plains, crystal
Watercourses, underground pools,
Virgin forest, and powdery
White sands.
This is Bohol

Then answer the questions that follow.
Magellan
By Yoyoy Villame
On March 16, 1521
When Philippines was discovered by 
Magellan
They were sailing day and night across 
the big ocean
Until they saw a small Limasawa island
Magellan landed in Limasawa at noon
The people met him very welcome on the 
shore
They did not understand the speaking 
they have done
Because Kastila gid at Waray-Waray 
man
When Magellan landed in Cebu City
Rajah Humabon met him, they were very 
happy
All people were baptized and built the 
church of Christ
And that’s the beginning of our Catholic 
life
When Magellan visited in Mactan
To christianize them everyone
But Lapu-Lapu met him on the shore
and drive Magellan to go back home
Then Magellan got so mad
Ordered his men to camouflage
“Mactan island we could not grab
‘Cause Lapu Lapu is very hard”
Then the battle began at dawn
Bolos and spears versus guns and
cannons
When Magellan was hit on his neck
He stumble down and cried and cried

                            15. What I Need to Know Before we explore the music of the Lumon Lowlands, let us first recall the different musical elements that you have learned in your previous music lessons The first element is Rhythm. Rhythm is the regular repeated pametne sounds. It serves as the pulse of the musical composition. This element has three components beat, tempo and meter. Do you think you can identify these components in a certain music while listening to it? Have you experienced nodding your head or tapping your foot every time you hear music? If so, you are actua feeling the beat of the music. In singing your favorite videoke tune, you are actually singing the rhythm because of the different note durations of the lyrics of the song Tempo is the speed of the beat. Every music has its own speed which depends on the mood of the whole music. Most happy tunes are fast while sed music is relatively slow The meter, which composes of time signature is the combination of strong beats (accent) and weak beats For example four four time signature is like counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. This type of meter is commonly used in pop songs. In time , signature, you just count 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 and so on. This meter is commonls used in waltz music. For the time signature two four), you just count 1, 2.1, 2.1. 2 and so on. Marches, polkas use this kind of meter. 2​</h2><br />
