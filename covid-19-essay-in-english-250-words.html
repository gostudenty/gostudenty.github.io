                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the inadequacy of public health systems worldwide, casting a shadow that we could not have imagined even a year ago. As the fog of confusion lifts and we begin to understand the rudiments of how the virus behaves, the end of the pandemic is nowhere in sight. The number of cases and the deaths continue to rise. The latter breached the 1 million mark a few weeks ago and it looks likely now that, in terms of severity, this pandemic will surpass the Asian Flu of 1957-58 and the Hong Kong Flu of 1968-69.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a parallel problem may well exceed the direct death toll from the virus. We are referring to the growing economic crises globally, and the prospect that these may hit emerging economies especially hard.</p><p></p><p>The economic fall-out is not entirely the direct outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic but a result of how we have responded to it—what measures governments took and how ordinary people, workers, and firms reacted to the crisis. The government activism to contain the virus that we saw this time exceeds that in previous such crises, which may have dampened the spread of the COVID-19 but has extracted a toll from the economy.</p><p></p><p>This essay takes stock of the policies adopted by governments in emerging economies, and what effect these governance strategies may have had, and then speculates about what the future is likely to look like and what we may do here on.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Heavily shaken by the corona pandemics many of us are currently thinking about how we could contribute to overcome this unprecedented situation. The COVID-19 crisis not only challenges disease control and crisis management, but may also have long-term and far-reaching impacts on states, societies and international cooperation. There are increasing indications that the world will look different after the crisis and that globalization will be questioned in many areas. According to these observations, the COVID-19 crisis would mark a turning point. In times of deep uncertainty, science is asked to look to the future and to flank a rational discourse about how to react to the current global crisis, and therefore now better cope with other tantamount global challenges such as the climate change.</p><p></p><p>Since this challenge is genuinely interdisciplinary, Institutes for Advanced Studies are rich pools to fish for visionary ideas and scientific observations. We are very happy that a number of distinguished and young scholars from different fields and countries agreed to write short essays on how the world will change and how it should change. The pieces will be posted bit by bit, two texts per week. Since science and art make a good couple in developing a good sensorium for tectonic shifts we also asked the comic artist Oliver Grajewski to complement and contrast the academic way of thinking. He will deliver one short comic series each week.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>matolog</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ka baby ko yan wala nang iba </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Some mutated species of the Coronavirus family, which is commonly accepted as a disease agent in animals, can also cause diseases in humans. We have witnessed examples of this as SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2011, both of them being severe lower respiratory tract infections. The causative pathogen of the disease, which has become a pandemic (a worldwide epidemic) today, is named the SARS-CoV2 virus, and the disease it causes is COVID-19. It causes serious lower respiratory failure, as in previous examples, and may damage the central nervous system in the early period, unlike the previous ones.1 Like other members of the Coronavirus family, this virus has a sheath called the envelope in its fat structure, which has spiky protrusions of its protein          </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>structure on its outer surface. Because it looks like a “crown” due to these spiky protrusions, it is referred to as “corona”, meaning crown (figure). The spiky proteins of the SARS-CoV2 virus differ from the SARS virus by 2% and provide much better adhesion to human cells.2  The virus </p><br />

                            10. My experience during covid-19 pandemic essay 200 words</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have spent a lot of time finding my new flow. I was the type of student who lived by the saying “The early bird gets the worm." I would often wake up early, get a couple hours of studying in every weekday before classes at either a coffee shop of on campus. I would usually work on assignments between classes, and I would sometimes stay on campus after class to finish up my work. When I went home, I was home, and I did a good job of not taking my work home with me. This is how I found balance, and it really worked for me!  </p><p>When campus had to be closed due to the government’s orders, classes transitioned to Zoom calls. Usually, most course material and class assignments were submitted online, so that part didn't change much, but there was a huge barrier I had to work hard to overcome: being home and doing school work. I had to get creative, so I set up a space in my dining room that acted as my office. I had a really fun time decorating it, putting plants in it for me to enjoy while studying, using candles and crystals to create a focused, calm environment. I bought an adjustable desk that I used to stand during lectures, which was a great way for me to switch things up when I started to feel distracted. I also bought a comfy seat cushion for when I needed to sit and study. I made the most of my classes and maintained my motivation by continuing to check in with my friends in my cohort, and scheduling out my days.  </p><p>Now when I have classes, I usually wake up at 7am, make some coffee, get dressed and have a fueling and delicious breakfast! My “work time” which consisted of Zoom lectures, working on assignments and studying was usually from 8am until 6pm. I would take a break mid-day and go for a nice walk around my neighborhood, often down to Lake Sammamish, and get a quick bite to eat when I got back. After my scheduled work time, I would enjoy time with my partner (who was living with me during the stay-at-home order), usually by cooking a home-made meal, watching a movie, making art and crafting or listening to audiobooks.  </p><p>There was a lot of restructuring and relearning how to be a student during the COVID-19 pandemic, but even with the added challenges and changes to the structure of the University because of COVID-19, the bonds between my cohort and my friends are holding strong. I still was able to get the most out of my classes (something I realized after reflecting on all I had learned during the school year!), and overall I still really value my experience during my second year. I think that speaks to the dedication of the administration, the dependability of the staff, and how invested our professors are. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Under these circumstances, one can imagine the psychological toll is significant. While there is no doubt that COVID-19 is causing significant stress, we won’t grasp the long-term mental health effects until we conduct future research. At the same time, and because of this pandemic, we see a positive impact on the way we consider mental health and how the healthcare system operates. Removing barriers and improving access to care. Since the COVID pandemic, the mental health field has shifted almost completely to telehealth encounters with visits through video or phone. This shift, together with the response from insurers to expand payment for telehealth have resulted in better integration of care and improved access. And to reducing the stigma of experiencing emotional distress and mental illness.  As we face this crisis together, and as the issues of mental health and wellness continue to be in the forefront of daily news coverage, the importance of physical safety as well as emotional well-being are normalized and becoming household concerns.</p><br />

In recent weeks the spread of COVID-19 in the Region has slowed, due in large part to the unprecedented physical distancing measures that countries implemented early and aggressively. Several Member States are now preparing to safely transition towards a “new normal” in which social and economic life can function amid low disease transmission. To do that successfully, countries must continue to be bold, decisive and mobilize the full power of their whole-of-government, whole-of-society approaches.<br />

                        <p>God allow the Covid 19 pandemic to happen because He wants us to know that everyday in our lives we need Him through worst and best. And He wants us to learn that no matter what obstacles we went trough, we will survive, we will overcome that situation as long as we cooperate together. Cause if its not because of the protocol we wont survive this kind of disaster. Thousands of people had lost their lives because of this virus, and even now there's still a few of it. Thats why we should respect the cautions that have been given to us, because we knew if we follow whats best for our safety we wouldnt get in danger or allow ourselves in risk. To all people who still overcome this difficult year of our lives Im so happy that we didnt give up or think that we wont get trough this. I know God has many reason or porpuses why did this happen. But all along I believe God is real and I know He wouldnt leave us in this kind of situation. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The balikbayan box is an iconic part of Filipino culture. It is a large box filled with goods and gifts that overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) send to their loved ones back home. These boxes are usually sent during holidays or special occasions and serve as a tangible reminder of the OFW's love and sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>The balikbayan box is not just a box of material possessions, but it is also a representation of the deep connection between the OFW and their family. It symbolizes the hardships and sacrifices that OFWs endure while working abroad to provide for their loved ones back home. These boxes contain items that range from simple everyday goods to luxury items, all chosen with care and affection.</p><p></p><p>The balikbayan box also plays a significant role in the Philippine economy. According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, remittances from OFWs account for around 10% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The balikbayan box is a vital part of these remittances, and its contents help support local businesses and stimulate the economy.</p><p></p><p>Despite its significance, the balikbayan box has faced some challenges, including stricter regulations on its contents and shipping. However, it remains an essential part of Filipino culture and a testament to the love and sacrifices of OFWs.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the balikbayan box is more than just a box of goods; it is a representation of the love and sacrifice of OFWs for their families. It serves as a vital lifeline for many Filipinos back home and plays a significant role in the Philippine economy. The balikbayan box is a testament to the resilience and determination of the Filipino people and will continue to be a significant part of Filipino culture for generations to come.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A balikbayan box is a package filled with goods and personal items sent by overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) to their families and loved ones back home in the Philippines. The term "balikbayan" literally means "returning home," and the box is a tangible expression of the OFW's love and affection for their families.</p><p></p><p>The balikbayan box has become an important part of Filipino culture, symbolizing the sacrifice and hard work of OFWs who are working abroad to provide a better life for their families. The contents of the box can range from simple household items like soap, canned goods, and clothing to luxury items like electronics and designer clothes.</p><p>Sending a balikbayan box is not just about sending material goods, but also about staying connected with loved ones back home. For OFWs, the box is a way to show their families that they are thinking of them and that they care, even though they are far away.</p><p></p><p>The balikbayan box also has economic significance for the Philippines, as the influx of these packages provides a boost to the country's economy. The government has even declared the balikbayan box as tax-free, recognizing its importance as a means of support for families and a source of revenue for the country.</p><p></p><p>However, there have been concerns about the misuse of the balikbayan box system, with some individuals using it to smuggle contraband or evade taxes. To address these issues, the government has implemented stricter regulations and guidelines for the sending and receiving of balikbayan boxes.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, the balikbayan box remains a beloved tradition among Filipinos all over the world. It serves as a reminder of the strong family ties and sense of community that characterize Filipino culture, and a symbol of the resilience and perseverance of OFWs who work hard to support their families and build a better future for themselves and their loved ones.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Some mutated species of the Coronavirus family, which is commonly accepted as a disease agent in animals, can also cause diseases in humans. We have witnessed examples of this as SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2011, both of them being severe lower respiratory tract infections. The causative pathogen of the disease, which has become a pandemic (a worldwide epidemic) today, is named the SARS-CoV2 virus, and the disease it causes is COVID-19. It causes serious lower respiratory failure, as in previous examples, and may damage the central nervous system in the early period, unlike the previous ones.1 Like other members of the Coronavirus family, this virus has a sheath called the envelope in its fat structure, which has spiky protrusions of its protein structure on its outer surface. Because it looks like a “crown” due to these spiky protrusions, it is referred to as “corona”, meaning crown (figure). The spiky proteins of the SARS-CoV2 virus differ from the SARS virus by 2% and provide much better adhesion to human cells.2  The virus is a non-living pathogen agent with its nucleic acid chain (a kind of helical amino acid chain that carries genetic codes) in the envelope. The virus can replicate itself, cause damage, and spread only when it infiltrates into another cell. For the SARS-Cov2 virus to infiltrate into cells, its envelope structure must be strong. The virus becomes harmless as oil solvents such as soap or detergent damage the envelope structure. It can remain infectious for only a few days if it cannot infiltrate into the cell provided that its envelope structure is strong. The exposed virus is deformed over time and becomes ineffective. When a sufficient number of SARS-CoV2 enters the human body, the infection begins once the virus clings onto the surface epithelium (a skin-like but much thinner, a single layer of cell covering the inner cavities of our body) and then infiltrates the cell.3</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps ༼ つ ◕◡◕ ༽つ</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>pandemic is of a scale most people alive today have never seen. Lockdowns and curfews to contain the spread of the virus impacted the way children learn, the way their families earn a living, and how safe they feel in their homes and communities. Despite the ongoing threat, countries around the world are starting to lift restrictions. As we question whether we will ever go back to what we once knew to be “normal”, its worth taken a step back to see how we can build on what we have learned to build back a better world for children. </p><br />
