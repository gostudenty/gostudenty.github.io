If the literature scarcity makes a bad RRL, so does literature excessiveness (Amorado, 2015:73).3. RRL is the meat and crux of research; it is the foundation of the research manuscript. Without literature and without RRL, it is not research ( Amorado, 2015:28).4. RRL writing style is both creative and technical. Creativity comes in the form of storyline and scripts, transitions, connecting concepts and integrating ideas. The technical aspects refer to the research formats, sentence construction, rules of grammar, methodological requirements (Amorado, 2015:29).5. Intelligence without integrity results in impunity; integrity without intelligence...to mediocrity (Amorado, 2011:2).​</a>

                                            The Cask of AmontilladoBy Edgar Allan PoeTHE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had bome as I best could, but when heventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will notsuppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was apoint definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded theidea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed whenretribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to makehimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause todoubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did notperceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.He had a weak point - this Fortunato - although in other regards he was a man tobe respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Fewitalians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit thetime and opportunity to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. Inpainting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of oldwines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: -- was skillful in theItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I couldIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season,that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had beendrinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and hishead was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that Ithought I should never have done wringing his hand.​</a>

                                            St. Augustine in his book City of God restated Cicero’s parable showing that Alexander the Great was little more than a leader of a robber band (group of thieves): And so if justice is left out, what are kingdoms except great robber bands? For what are robber bands except little kingdoms? The band also is a group of men governed by the orders of a leader, bound by a social compact (idea that individuals give up some of their rights to a group or state), and its booty (treasure) is divided according to a law agreed upon. If by repeatedly adding desperate men this plague grows to the point where it holds territory and establishes a fixed seat (capitol), seizes cities and subdues people, then it more conspicuously (easily to see) assumes the name of kingdom, and this name is now openly granted to it, not for any subtraction of cupidity (greed), but by addition of impunity (exempt from punishment). For it was an elegant and true reply that was made to Alexander the Great by a certain pirate whom he had captured. When the king asked him what he was thinking of, that he should molest (harass/bother) the sea, he said with defiant independence: 'The same as you when you molest the world! Since I do this with a little ship I am called a pirate. You do it with a great fleet (army) and are called emperor'.

He wants to exact this revenge, however, in a measured way, without placing himself at risk. He decides to use Fortunato’s fondness for wine against him. During the carnival season, Montresor, wearing a mask of black silk, approaches Fortunato. He tells Fortunato that he has acquired something that could pass for Amontillado, a light Spanish sherry. Fortunato (Italian for “fortunate”) wears the multicolored costume of the jester, including a cone cap with bells. Montresor tells Fortunato that if he is too busy, he will ask a man named Luchesi to taste it. Fortunato apparently considers Luchesi a competitor and claims that this man could not tell Amontillado from other types of sherry. Fortunato is anxious to taste the wine and to determine for Montresor whether or not it is truly Amontillado. Fortunato insists that they go to Montresor’s vaults.Montresor has strategically planned for this meeting by sending his servants away to the carnival. The two men descend into the damp vaults, which are covered with nitre, or saltpeter, a whitish mineral. Apparently aggravated by the nitre, Fortunato begins to cough. The narrator keeps offering to bring Fortunato back home, but Fortunato refuses. Instead, he accepts wine as the antidote to his cough. The men continue to explore the deep vaults, which are full of the dead bodies of the Montresor family. In response to the crypts, Fortunato claims to have forgotten Montresor’s family coat of arms and motto. Montresor responds that his family shield portrays “a huge human foot d’or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.” The motto, in Latin, is “nemo me impune lacessit,” that is, “no one attacks me with impunity.”Later in their journey, Fortunato makes a hand movement that is a secret sign of the Masons, an exclusive fraternal organization. Montresor does not recognize this hand signal, though he claims that he is a Mason. When Fortunato asks for proof, Montresor shows him his trowel, the implication being that Montresor is an actual stonemason. Fortunato says that he must be jesting, and the two men continue onward. The men walk into a crypt, where human bones decorate three of the four walls. The bones from the fourth wall have been thrown down on the ground. On the exposed wall is a small recess, where Montresor tells Fortunato that the Amontillado is being stored. Fortunato, now heavily intoxicated, goes to the back of the recess. Montresor then suddenly chains the slow-footed Fortunato to a stone.Taunting Fortunato with an offer to leave, Montresor begins to wall up the entrance to this small crypt, thereby trapping Fortunato inside. Fortunato screams confusedly as Montresor builds the first layer of the wall. The alcohol soon wears off and Fortunato moans, terrified and helpless. As the layers continue to rise, though, Fortunato falls silent. Just as Montresor is about to finish, Fortunato laughs as if Montresor is playing a joke on him, but Montresor is not joking. At last, after a final plea, “For the love of God, Montresor!” Fortunato stops answering Montresor, who then twice calls out his enemy’s name. After no response, Montresor claims that his heart feels sick because of the dampness of the catacombs. He fits the last stone into place and plasters the wall closed, his actions accompanied only by the jingling of Fortunato’s bells. He finally repositions the bones on the fourth wall. For fifty years, he writes, no one has disturbed them. He concludes with a Latin phrase meaning “May he rest in peace.”</p><br />

                            18. The Cask of AmontilladoBy Edgar Allan PoeTHE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had bome as I best could, but when heventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will notsuppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was apoint definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded theidea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed whenretribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to makehimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause todoubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did notperceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.He had a weak point - this Fortunato - although in other regards he was a man tobe respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Fewitalians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit thetime and opportunity to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. Inpainting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of oldwines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: -- was skillful in theItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I couldIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season,that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had beendrinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and hishead was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that Ithought I should never have done wringing his hand.​</h2><br />

                            25. St. Augustine in his book City of God restated Cicero’s parable showing that Alexander the Great was little more than a leader of a robber band (group of thieves): And so if justice is left out, what are kingdoms except great robber bands? For what are robber bands except little kingdoms? The band also is a group of men governed by the orders of a leader, bound by a social compact (idea that individuals give up some of their rights to a group or state), and its booty (treasure) is divided according to a law agreed upon. If by repeatedly adding desperate men this plague grows to the point where it holds territory and establishes a fixed seat (capitol), seizes cities and subdues people, then it more conspicuously (easily to see) assumes the name of kingdom, and this name is now openly granted to it, not for any subtraction of cupidity (greed), but by addition of impunity (exempt from punishment). For it was an elegant and true reply that was made to Alexander the Great by a certain pirate whom he had captured. When the king asked him what he was thinking of, that he should molest (harass/bother) the sea, he said with defiant independence: 'The same as you when you molest the world! Since I do this with a little ship I am called a pirate. You do it with a great fleet (army) and are called emperor'.
