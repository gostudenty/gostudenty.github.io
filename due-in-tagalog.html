                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

Baguio City has been Northern Luzon's university hub for
many decades. Unbeknownst to most, it is also a cultural
melting pot due to numerous influences from different
cultures, not just from people of Cordilleran descent, but
also from people from Pangasinan and the Ilocos region.
The most common languages spoken in the city are Ilokano.
Kankana-ey, and Ifugao, as well as Pangasinense and
Tagalog. English and Filipino are also understood by most
inhabitants of the city.</a>

Mahayana Buddhism
In the previous lesson, we have learned What according to the Buddha, the path to happiness starts from an understanding of the root cause of suffering. Just like a physician who diagnosed the sickness of human persons as "suffering" due to "craving," the Buddha prescribes a proactive course of treatment for the "sick" person through "Dharma." Part of the "treatment" is the "Eight-fold Path" which the "sick" person must practice through mindful thought and action. In this lesson, we shall discover another form of Buddhism which also originated from the teachings and examples of the Buddha but has taken a different course.</a>

                                            The Bantay Watchtower, or Bantay Belfry, is located in a little town called Bantay 10 minutes from Vigan City. Built in 1591, it once served as a watchtower for the Spanish colonists as a defense against the potential risk of invading pirates. The word 'bantay' means 'guard' in Tagalog; and even though the Bantay Watchtower was turned into a bell tower by the nearby church in 1857, it still was used as a watchtower during the two World Wars due to its strategic location.pa translate po into tagalog,thanks ​</a>

Earthquake is the vibration of the Earth due to rapid release of energy30. Meteorologists are scientists who study meteors and other Near Earth Objects,31. Hygrometer measures the atmospheric pressure,32. The direction of typhoon in the Philippines is northwest33. S-waves can travel in solids, liquids and gases,34. The origin of the earthquake wherein the energy is being released is called focus,35. The disturbance that passes through a medium and transmits energy from one point to another is called wave36. The English term for the Tagalog word "bagyo" Is Typhoon37. Most of the asteroids that orbit the sun are found in a region called the Asteroid Belt. It is located between Mercury and Jupiter38. Comet Halley is the most famous short period comet with an orbital period of 75 76 years39. Asterold is a small rocky body/object orbiting the sun40.

ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project will provide food for 55.000 low-income families, informal settlers, and families who have lost their livelihoods due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

ADB has launched an emergency food provision program on 31 March, following the approval of the $5 million Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision technical assistance program. The grant is implemented under the Tagalog name Bayan Bayanihan, the well-known Filipino principle of sharing what one has with one's community.The program provides for essential food supplies to around 55,000 of the most vulnerable households in the National Capital Region and neighboring areas, affected by income losses for daily wage earners due to the enhanced quarantine to contain COVID-19. It will act as a 'bridge' support until ADB's large-scale cash transfer program is rolled out. The program has a collaboration platform to attract private sector and philanthropic contributions for its expansion.1. What is the newsflash about?2.

Baguio City has been Northern Luzon's university hub for
many decades. Unbeknownst to most, it is also a cultural
melting pot due to numerous influences from different
cultures, not just from people of Cordilleran descent, but
also from people from Pangasinan and the Ilocos region.

Kankana-ey, and Ifugao, as well as Pangasinense and
Tagalog. English and Filipino are also understood by most

Mahayana Buddhism
In the previous lesson, we have learned What according to the Buddha, the path to happiness starts from an understanding of the root cause of suffering. Just like a physician who diagnosed the sickness of human persons as "suffering" due to "craving," the Buddha prescribes a proactive course of treatment for the "sick" person through "Dharma." Part of the "treatment" is the "Eight-fold Path" which the "sick" person must practice through mindful thought and action. In this lesson, we shall discover another form of Buddhism which also originated from the teachings and examples of the Buddha but has taken a different course.</h2><br />

                            25. The Bantay Watchtower, or Bantay Belfry, is located in a little town called Bantay 10 minutes from Vigan City. Built in 1591, it once served as a watchtower for the Spanish colonists as a defense against the potential risk of invading pirates. The word 'bantay' means 'guard' in Tagalog; and even though the Bantay Watchtower was turned into a bell tower by the nearby church in 1857, it still was used as a watchtower during the two World Wars due to its strategic location.pa translate po into tagalog,thanks ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:Ang Bantay Bantayan, o Bantay Belfry, ay matatagpuan sa isang maliit na bayan na tinatawag na Bantay 10 minuto mula sa Vigan City. Itinayo noong 1591, minsan itong nagsilbing bantayan ng mga kolonyalistang Espanyol bilang depensa laban sa potensyal na panganib ng pagsalakay ng mga pirata. Ang salitang 'bantay' ay nangangahulugang 'bantay' sa Tagalog; at kahit na ang Bantay Watchtower ay ginawang kampanilya ng kalapit na simbahan noong 1857, ginamit pa rin ito bilang bantayan noong dalawang Digmaang Pandaigdig dahil sa estratehikong lokasyon nito.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />
