Primary Reflection calculates and analyses past events. 2. Placing myself outside the thing that I am investigating is Secondary Reflection. 3. Secondary Reflection recuperates the unity of original experience. 4. Primary Reflection unites rather than divide. 5. Examining objects by its abstraction is Primary Reflection.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>principles of trainingIn order to get the maximum out of your training, you need to apply the five key principles of training – specificity, individualisation, progressive overload, variation and be aware of reversibility.The principles of training are the five key areas that you need to focus on and are as follows:1- SPECIFICITY Your training has to be specific to the goal you are setting out the achieve, there is little point in training for a marathon if your goal race is a 5K. The stresses that are applied to the body in training must be the same as those experienced in your chosen sport or adventure, so going back to the point above. Your time is better spent focussing on speed rather than chugging out a 20-mile long run. This principle gets totally disregarded if you are training for general fitness, whereas anything goes!  2- INDVIDUALISATIONThis is a crucial principle, the fundamental fact that everyone is different and not all training is going to be suited for everyone! Different people respond to training in a different way. If you are walking or cycling with a friend, and doing exactly the same amount of training, don’t be concerned if one of you gets fitter faster than the other – this is what individualisation is all about. The same goes for training with someone who is fitter than you, it may come to a point where you are starting to overtake them instead! Lifestyle can play a big part in this, you are going to feel more rested for exercise and able to recover more if you work from home on a laptop, compared to someone who does a lot of hours and manual labour daily with minimal rest. Some days your training can go really well and the next day, even though it was exactly the same length workout, it can be a nightmare. This is what individualisation is all about.3- PROGRESSIVE OVERLOADThis is all about the need to gradually increase the workload that you put your body through. An example of this is in weight training, you wouldn’t stick to the same weight constantly otherwise you won’t make any gains, so you would safely increase the weight to gain strength throughout the weeks. active-adult-body-1032117.jpg It is essential to combine training and rest whilst at the same time increasing the stress that the body is put through. This so-called ‘stress’ is a combination of the frequency, intensity time and type of the workout:FREQUENCY: This is the amount of time you are going to be exercising throughout the week or the number of reps/sets you are going to be doing of a given exercise.INTENSITY: How hard you are going to be pushing is going to determine what kind of session you are going to be doing. If it feels like a 7 on the RPE scale if you are training by effort. TIME: This is how long you are going to be working out for, this again can relate to how long a certain rep is as well as how long you are going to be exercising for as a whole. TYPE: The type of exercise you are going to be doing, dictates what you are going to be training, are you relying on your cardiovascular endurance with a longer run? Or your strength with a weight lifting session?Progression is all about <p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The joy of eating well and aging well</strong></p><p></p><p>For adults 55+ the benefits of healthy eating include increased mental acuteness, resistance to illness and disease, higher energy levels, faster recuperation times, and better management of chronic health problems. As we age, eating well can also be the key to a positive outlook and staying emotionally balanced.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fortunately,</strong> healthy eating at any age doesn’t have to be about dieting and sacrifice. Eating well as an older adult is a lifestyle that embraces fresh, colorful food, creativity in the kitchen, and eating with friends. You are the boss when it comes to food choices and by making healthy choices you can supercharge your life and experience the joy of eating well and aging well.</p><p></p><p><strong>Remember the old adage</strong>, you are what you eat? Make it your motto. When you choose a variety of colorful fruits and veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins you’ll feel simply marvelous inside and out.</p><p></p><p><strong>Live longer and stronger</strong> – Good nutrition keeps muscles, bones, organs, and other body parts strong for the long haul. Eating vitamin-rich food boosts immunity and fights illness-causing toxins. A proper diet reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, type-2 diabetes, bone loss, cancer, and anemia. Also, eating sensibly means consuming fewer calories and more nutrient-dense foods, keeping weight in check.</p><p></p><p><strong>Sharpen the mind</strong> – Key nutrients are essential for the brain to do its job. People who eat a selection of brightly colored fruit, leafy veggies, and fish and nuts packed with omega-3 fatty acids can improve focus and decrease their risk of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p></p><p><strong>Feel bette</strong><strong>r </strong>– Wholesome meals give you more energy and help you look better, resulting in a self-esteem boost. It’s all connected—when your body feels good you feel happier inside and out.</p><p></p><p><strong>55+ Nutrition: What your body needs:</strong></p><p></p><p>Older adults can feel better immediately and stay healthy for the future by choosing healthy foods. A balanced diet and physical activity contribute to a higher quality of life and enhanced independence as you age.</p><p></p><p><strong>55+ Food pyramid guidelines</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Fruits</strong> – Focus on whole fruits rather than juices for more fiber and vitamins and aim for around 1 ½ to 2 servings each day. Break the apple and banana rut and go for color-rich pickings like berries or melons.</p><p></p><p><strong>Veggies </strong>– Color is your credo in this category. Choose anti-oxidant rich dark leafy greens, such as kale, spinach, and broccoli as well as oranges and yellows, such as carrots, squash, and yams. Try for 2 to 2 ½ cups of veggies every day.</p><p></p><p><strong>Calcium</strong> – Aging bone health depends on adequate calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis and bone fractures. Adults 55+ need 1,200 mg of calcium a day through servings of milk, yogurt, or cheese. Non-dairy sources include tofu, broccoli, almonds, and kale.</p><p></p><p><strong>Grains </strong>– Be smart with your carbs and choose whole grains over processed white flour for more nutrients and a higher fiber count. If you’re not sure, look for pasta, breads, and cereals that list “whole” in the ingredient list. Adults 55+ need 6-7 ounces of grains each day (one ounce is about 1 slice of bread).</p><p></p><p><strong>Proteins</strong> – Adults 55+ need about .5 grams per pound of bodyweight. Simply divide your bodyweight in half to know how many grams you need. A 130-pound woman will need around 65 grams of protein a day. A serving of tuna, for example, has about 40 grams of protein. Vary your sources with more fish, beans, peas, nuts, eggs, milk, cheese, and seeds.</p><p></p><p><strong>Important vitamin and minerals</strong></p><p><strong>Water </strong>– Adults 55+ are prone to dehydration because our bodies lose some of its ability to regulate fluid levels and our sense of thirst is dulled as we age. Post a note in your kitchen reminding you to sip water every hour and with meals to avoid urinary tract infections, constipation, and possibly confusion.</p><p></p><p><strong>Vitamin B</strong> – After 50, your stomach produces less gastric acid making it difficult to absorb vitamin B-12—needed to help keep blood and nerves vital. Get the recommended daily intake (2.4 mcg) of B12 from fortified foods or a vitamin supplement.</p><p></p><p><strong>Vitamin D </strong>– We get most of our vitamin D intake—essential to absorbing calcium—through sun exposure and certain foods (fatty fish, egg yolk, and fortified milk). With age, our skin is less efficient at synthesizing vitamin D, so consult your doctor about supplementing with fortified foods or a multivitamin.</p><p></p><p><strong>Changing dietary needs and physical changes</strong></p><p></p><p>Every season of life brings changes and adjustments to your body. Understanding what is happening will help you take control of your nutrition requirements.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Hope it helps</strong></p><p><strong>#Carry on Learning</strong></p><p>Basahin nyo po yung ibang answer nasa Comments po</p><p><strong>Pa Brainlest po ^-^</strong></p><br />
