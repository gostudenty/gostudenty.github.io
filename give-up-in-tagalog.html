Personal development is closely linked to
self-awareness. It gives you the opportunity
to take an honest look at the areas of your
life that need improvement. Through this
process, you get to know who you really
are, what your true values are, and where
you would like to go in life. It is very important in order for us students
not to regret our decisions in life. We
should think thoroughly because we may
never know what will happen in the future.
Be mature enough and grow up to think
what you should want to be in the future.</a>

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

                                             pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</a>

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />

                            17.  pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang pamamahala ng Hapon ay minsang nakaakit ng pandaigdigang atensyon Napakahirap para sa mga Kanluranin na maunawaan kung bakit ang mga empleyado ay nagtatrabaho nang husto para sa isang kumpanya. Napagpasyahan ng maraming tagamasid na ang Japan ay may ilang mahiwagang 1 t 3 na sistema ng pamamahala. Ngunit nagkamali sila. Nag-ugat ang Japanese work force sa isang tradisyon na pinahahalagahan ang kasipagan. Ang dahilan kung bakit napakahusay ng ilang negosyo sa Japan ay dahil ang kanilang mga empleyado ay nagbabahagi ng hanay ng mga halagang ito at nagsusumikap para sa kumpanya. Sa susunod na dekada, ang bagong henerasyon, na lumaki sa mas mayayamang panahon, ay bubuo ng karamihan sa lakas ng trabaho, at ang indibidwalismo ay mauuna. Ang pagbaba ng mga kumpanyang Hapones ay maaaring magsimula kung ang labis na indibidwalismo ay humantong sa kanilang mga tao na mawalan ng pagpapahalaga sa halaga ng trabaho. Sa Estados Unidos ngayon, ang mga kumpanyang tulad ng Hewlett-Packard at IBM, na nagtataguyod ng mga ideyal at pilosopiya ng korporasyon, ay patuloy na umuunlad. Walang kumpanyang dapat umasa lamang sa katutubong kasipagan o tradisyonal na pagpapahalaga ng mga empleyado upang magtagumpay. Dapat tayong magtakda ng pilosopiya ng kumpanya para sa ating mga kabataang empleyado, ibahagi sa kanila ang tunay na kahulugan ng trabaho, at bigyan sila ng layunin sa buhay.</p><br />

Isang buong pangako ang iniisip ko
Hindi mo ito makukuha sa ibang lalaki
Gusto ko lang sabihin sayo ang nararamdaman ko
Kailangang ipaintindi sa iyo
Hinding hindi kita ibibigay
hinding hindi kita pababayaan
Hinding hindi ka tatakbo at iiwan ka
Hinding hindi ka paiiyakin

Hinding-hindi ka magsisinungaling at sasaktan
Matagal na tayong magkakilala
Ang iyong puso ay sumasakit, ngunit ikaw ay nahihiya upang sabihin ito (sabihin ito)
Sa loob, alam nating dalawa kung ano ang nangyayari (nagyayari)
Alam namin ang laro at lalaruin namin ito
At kung tatanungin mo ako kung ano ang nararamdaman ko
