                                            Maaga pa lamang ay bumalik na ang grupo ng Biyahe ni Drew sa Mariveles Portpara simulan ang tour sa isang sikat na touristspot, ang Five Fingers.Tinawag itong Five Fingers dahil kung titingnan gamit ang Satelite, makikita mula sa itaas na hugis daliri ang limang isla. Mula sa Mariveles Port,aabutin ng dalawampu’t limang minutong boat ride angpa-ChochicosPoint, ang thumb o hinlalaki ng limang isla. Tinawag na Chochitos Point ang isla mula sa Spanish word na chochitos na nangangahulugang baboy sa tagalog, dahil kung titingnan ito sa airial shot ang isla ay hugis baboy. At dahil summer, mapapansin na wala masyadong halaman o vegetation ang bundok dahil sa wild fire. Pero kung gustong makita na berde ang paligid, bumisita tuwing “ber” month dahil buhay na buhay ang mga halaman at berdeng-berde ang mga bundok. Ang Five Fingers ay nagsisilbing tirahan ng mga Lawin sa buong Mariveles. Ito ay nangangahulugan malusog ang environment dito at hindi ito nagagalaw. Marami ring wild life ang makikita sa paligid ngunit marami ring nakalutang na basura dala ng habagat at amihan season. Ang mga basurang galing sa Manila Bay ay dito napapadpad. Sa pagitan naman ng index finger o hintuturo ay tinawag nilang Talaga Beach, ang middle finger o Puntang Mahaba. Makikita ang cave na maaring pasukin o languyin kapag low tide. Dito rin maaaring mag- snorkeling. Ang mismong beach naman ng Puntang Haba ay sikat na sikat dahil sa naglalakihang bato na may iba’t ibang taas at laki. Katunayan, paboritong Instagram spot daw ito ng mga turista. Pero may ibang pasaway na bisita na walang magawa , isinulat ang kanilang mga pangalan sa bato at ipinagmamalaki pa sa IG. May parte rin nito na maaaring mag-cliff diving ngunit huwag basta-basta tatalon. Imporatanteng makinig muna sa tour guide kung saan safe na tumalon. Ang ring finger o palasingsingan o Naiclec Point.Dito namanmakikita ang iba’t ibang rock formation na tila hugis palaka. Puwede ring mag- snorkeling at swimming. At ang huling daliri ay ang pinky finger o hinliliit, ang Longos Kawayan. Kung prenup location ang hanap ito ang indemand pagdating sa mga couples at photographer na may gusto ng kakaibang konsepto. Marami kasing maaaring gawing background para sa picture tulad ng mga naglalakihang bato na may maliliit na butas sa ibaba. Puwede rin daw magmukhang naglalakad sa tubig sa gitna ng cove at puwede rin umakyat sa mga bato sa itaas at mag-post na tila nasa eksena ng pelikula ng Titanic o Lion King. Kahit anong post ay maari, mag-ingat lamang sa ibabaw ng mga bato dahil madali itong mabiyak. Matapos ang finger hopping, sinugod naman nila ang Kawader Camp kung saan naghihintay ang masarap na pananghalian.

A review of 46 studies of motorcycle helmets and helmet laws reported that every study comparing helmeted and non helmeted crash victims found that helmet riders had lower fatality rates, ranging from 28 percent to 7 percent lower Claim of Policy: The government should impone stricter rules for motorcycle riders 2. Research has found that the key to a healthy lifestyle is 30-40 minutes of exercise a day. Whether it is working out in a gym, brisk walking, jogging, swimming, riding a bike, or playing a sport, any kind of physical activity releases chemicals called endorphins which trigger a positive feeling in the body. Claim of Fact: 3. As coronavirus cases rise, DOH reiterates: Stay home, follow health protocols Claim of Policy: 4. Republic Act 11469 was signed into law on 23 March 2020 (also known by its short title as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act) declaring a national health emergency throughout the Philippines as a result of the COVID-19 situation. In it, Congress authorizes the President to exercise the necessary special powers, for a limited time and subject to certain restrictions, to address a problem that poses a clear and present danger to the people, Claim of Value: 5. Latest data from DepEd showed that 3,885,427 learners prefer "modular" wherein modules - either printed or digital - will be used as an alternative learning option. Claim of Fact: 6. The first half of the decade's final year saw disaster, death, and disease. It was a period of seemingly organized sequential events that brought tears, despair, and chaos in the lives of many Filipinos. It was like a monthly episode of calamity: a volcanic explosion in January, an animal virus outbreak in February, and a pandemic in March. Claim of Fact: 7. Parent involvement in education is crucial. No matter their income or background, students with involved parents are more likely to have higher grades and test scores, attend school regularly, have better social skills, show improved behavior and adapt well to school.

The engines fired, and the pod slowly moved away from the spaceship. Soon, I'd be the first person to travel outside our solar system Everyone should recycle. Recycling is one of the best things we can do for our planet. It makes less population. It also costs less money to recycle than to make something new. 3 4 Cheetahs are the fastest mammals on land. They can run more than 70 miles per hour! Their spots help them blend into the background. This helps them hunt their prey without being seen. When you visit areas where rattlesnakes live, wear boots to protect your feet. Do not walk-through bushes where you can't see the ground, and never stick your hands under rocks or logs. 5 6 Summer is the best season. The days are longer, so you can spend more time outside. Since it's warm, you can swim, camp, or enjoy outdoor sports. There are also many tasty fruits to eat, like watermelon Someone had stolen my brand-new bike from the front porch.

How?________________________________________________3.How will you monitor if you have a progress towards your fitness goals?________________________________________________​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The most important reason is that swimming is the only sport which can save your child's life. Drowning is still one of the most common causes of accidental death in children, so being able to swim is an essential life-saving skill.</p><p></p><p>2. Health benefits of swimming</p><p>builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness. helps maintain a healthy weight, healthy heart and lungs. tones muscles and builds strength. provides an all-over body workout, as nearly all of your muscles are used during swimming.</p><p></p><p>3. 1. Photos – If you’re trying to change how your body looks, the best way to see the progress is through photos. You often miss changes in the mirror because they happen slowly, on a daily basis. When you look back on photos a month, or couple of months apart, they show vast changes you have made, and this is great for increasing motivation.</p><p></p><p>2. Strength on key exercises – Getting stronger in the gym shows you are making progress. You don’t need to measure everything, but having a few key exercises where you track weights and reps is a good idea. If you’re using 10kg more than you were last month, you cannot argue that you are stronger than you were before.</p><p></p><p>3. Bodyweight – A simple measurement you can take on a regular basis is your bodyweight. Be aware that it doesn’t tell you everything. For example, you can build muscle and lean tissue, while losing fat and not see your weight change. That said, it’s still important to track your bodyweight to see general trends over time.</p><p></p><p>4. Desire to go to the gym – This is an uncommon one, but in my experience people who enjoy working out tend to do it more permanently, work harder, and see better results. This is a self-perpetuating cycle in that people who see good results tend to enjoy their workouts more, and feel more motivation to go to the gym. If you make it your goal to enjoy your workout, you will have a much easier time making it sustainable over the long term.</p><p></p><br />

C. The scientist works alone in a lab until he makes a dramatic breakthrough and then immediately announces the results through a worldwide press conference.
D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
6. A recent encyclopedia entry about dogs cites multiple research papers done by scientists at veterinary schools. According to the article, Labrador retrievers come in two specific breeds: English and American. The English breed is described as stocky and heavy, while the American breed is described as tall and lanky. The article describes current scientific research as showing that males of both breeds usually weigh about 29-41 kg (65-90 lb), and females weigh 25-32 kg (55-70 lb). Coat colors for both breeds come in solid black, yellow, or chocolate. All labs have strong tails and webbed feet, which help them swim. Devon would like to use this information to determine if his new dog is an English or American Labrador retriever. 
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1. D. </strong>We are given a solution that is 2.50 L, and the conversion that 1 quart =0.943 liters. Now, to convert, we can just multiply 2.50 L x (1 quart / 0.943 L) = 2.65 quarts. Note how the "liters unit" is cancelled and we are left with quarts.</p><br /><p><strong>2.

</p><p>D. Computers hold larger amounts of data.</p><p>Options  A-C are actually advantages of a graphing calculator. Because it is more portable (B), it is easier to use for quick calculations (A). Since it's also smaller, it has a lower power consumption (C). Computers, however, because of their computing capacity can hold larger amounts of data.</p><br /><p><strong>3.

</p><p>D. Create a question on the cause of a chemical reaction.</p><p>Options A, B, and D are part of pre-lab and post-lab procedures. Only option C  actually needs to be done during the experiment. You'd need A and D (hypothesis and question) before lab, to know what to test. Option B would come after the lab experiment, because there is already a completed lab report.</p><br /><p><strong>4.C.</strong> A scientist collected the following data, which show how the pressure of water vapor changes with temperature.

</p><p>B. Change the unit of pressure to atm.
</p><p>C. Make a graph for better visual representation.
</p><p>D. Display only rows 1, 3, and 6 of the data to simplify results.
</p><p>The data shows the relation of pressure and temperature, and the relationship between two quantities is best shown as a graph. Options A,B and D will still just give a lot of numbers which a layperson would probably have a difficult time understanding. Option D especially is a big NO, because you shouldn't just remove data like that. More than simplifying the results, it would change the results.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>5. A. </strong>A filmmaker wants to depict a realistic dramatization of a scientist making and communicating an important scientific discovery. Which plot description would best depict the methods of discovery and communication that a modern professional scientist uses?

</p><p>D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
</p><p>Option A is the answer because it is the only one that mentions peer reviews before releasing results. This is an important part of scientists discoveries since the discovery must be double-checked first before announced. It would just cause confusion if a scientist announces a wrong discovery.</p><p>

</p><p>A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.

                            19. Maaga pa lamang ay bumalik na ang grupo ng Biyahe ni Drew sa Mariveles Portpara simulan ang tour sa isang sikat na touristspot, ang Five Fingers.Tinawag itong Five Fingers dahil kung titingnan gamit ang Satelite, makikita mula sa itaas na hugis daliri ang limang isla. Mula sa Mariveles Port,aabutin ng dalawampu’t limang minutong boat ride angpa-ChochicosPoint, ang thumb o hinlalaki ng limang isla. Tinawag na Chochitos Point ang isla mula sa Spanish word na chochitos na nangangahulugang baboy sa tagalog, dahil kung titingnan ito sa airial shot ang isla ay hugis baboy. At dahil summer, mapapansin na wala masyadong halaman o vegetation ang bundok dahil sa wild fire. Pero kung gustong makita na berde ang paligid, bumisita tuwing “ber” month dahil buhay na buhay ang mga halaman at berdeng-berde ang mga bundok. Ang Five Fingers ay nagsisilbing tirahan ng mga Lawin sa buong Mariveles. Ito ay nangangahulugan malusog ang environment dito at hindi ito nagagalaw. Marami ring wild life ang makikita sa paligid ngunit marami ring nakalutang na basura dala ng habagat at amihan season. Ang mga basurang galing sa Manila Bay ay dito napapadpad. Sa pagitan naman ng index finger o hintuturo ay tinawag nilang Talaga Beach, ang middle finger o Puntang Mahaba. Makikita ang cave na maaring pasukin o languyin kapag low tide. Dito rin maaaring mag- snorkeling. Ang mismong beach naman ng Puntang Haba ay sikat na sikat dahil sa naglalakihang bato na may iba’t ibang taas at laki. Katunayan, paboritong Instagram spot daw ito ng mga turista. Pero may ibang pasaway na bisita na walang magawa , isinulat ang kanilang mga pangalan sa bato at ipinagmamalaki pa sa IG. May parte rin nito na maaaring mag-cliff diving ngunit huwag basta-basta tatalon. Imporatanteng makinig muna sa tour guide kung saan safe na tumalon. Ang ring finger o palasingsingan o Naiclec Point.Dito namanmakikita ang iba’t ibang rock formation na tila hugis palaka. Puwede ring mag- snorkeling at swimming. At ang huling daliri ay ang pinky finger o hinliliit, ang Longos Kawayan. Kung prenup location ang hanap ito ang indemand pagdating sa mga couples at photographer na may gusto ng kakaibang konsepto. Marami kasing maaaring gawing background para sa picture tulad ng mga naglalakihang bato na may maliliit na butas sa ibaba. Puwede rin daw magmukhang naglalakad sa tubig sa gitna ng cove at puwede rin umakyat sa mga bato sa itaas at mag-post na tila nasa eksena ng pelikula ng Titanic o Lion King. Kahit anong post ay maari, mag-ingat lamang sa ibabaw ng mga bato dahil madali itong mabiyak. Matapos ang finger hopping, sinugod naman nila ang Kawader Camp kung saan naghihintay ang masarap na pananghalian.
