bond papers for the company's use. She knew White Company, who previously assured her that they sell bond papers at the cheapest price in the area, so she went straight to them to purchase the needed items. Later on, she learned that Dino Company also sells bond papers but at a price much cheaper than White Company's. Ana went back to White Company and threatened them that she will have their contract annulled for being voidable on the ground that they defrauded her when the company represented that it sells bond papers at the cheapest price in the area.

                            3. Ana, a member of JC Company procurement team, is tasked to procure
bond papers for the company's use. She knew White Company, who previously assured her that they sell bond papers at the cheapest price in the area, so she went straight to them to purchase the needed items. Later on, she learned that Dino Company also sells bond papers but at a price much cheaper than White Company's. Ana went back to White Company and threatened them that she will have their contract annulled for being voidable on the ground that they defrauded her when the company represented that it sells bond papers at the cheapest price in the area. Is Ana correct? Why?</h2><br />
                        Answer<p>Ana is wrong because she will be violating the contract between JC Company and White Company. And second, she is at fault for making rushed decisions for the company. Ana should have made a procurement list before entering a contract with White Company.</p>Explanation<p>The contract between JC Company, represented by Ana, and White Company is called a Supplier Contract or Supply Contract. A Supplier Contract is defined as an agreement wherein the seller promises to supply goods or services that the buyer needs <strong>IN A CERTAIN TIME DURATION</strong> at a price agreed upon by the buyer. Hence, Ana cannot nullify the contract because there has been a legal agreement.</p><p></p><p><strong>A Unique Book That Many Hates - </strong>brainly.ph/question/2903514</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

                        <p>One way that households might cope with rising food prices is by finding ways to save money on groceries. This could include shopping at discount stores or bulk retailers, using coupons and discounts, and buying generic or store-brand products instead of name-brand items. Households could also try to stretch their food budget by using leftovers, buying in-season produce, and avoiding waste.</p><p></p><p>Another way to cope with rising food prices is by looking for alternative sources of food. For example, households could try growing their own fruits and vegetables in a home garden, joining a community garden, or purchasing produce directly from local farmers. These options can often provide fresher, healthier food at lower prices than what is available at supermarkets.</p><p></p><p>It is also important for the government to take action to address the situation with rising food prices. This could include providing support to farmers and other food producers, implementing policies to increase food security, and offering assistance to households struggling to afford food. The specific actions taken will depend on the details of the situation and the needs of the affected population.</p><p></p><p>In summary, rising food prices can be a challenge for households, especially during times of crisis. Households can try to save money on groceries and look for alternative sources of food, and the government can take action to address the situation and support those in need.</p><br />
