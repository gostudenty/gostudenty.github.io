                                             Rearrange the following paragraphs by labeling 1-5 to build a strong body of persuasive essay.______a) The main reason which may win most of people's support is that if lack the reading and writing ability, one would be considered as illiterate who has been deprived of the most basic right of human beings in the 21st century. ______b) The second reason I would like to point out is that people today who cannot read and write cannot even make a living. Good jobs are difficult to find because of economic depression.______c) It will be hard for us to imagine how somebody who can't read and write communicates with other people. A case in point is that one of my neighbors who is an old man and cannot read and write may only talk with others face to face. As for making friends by email and search information in newspaper, it is absolutely impossible. ______d) Furthermore, the ability to read and write could bring us lots of advantages. Suppose that people who have tired out with a hard week's sweat and effort may get lots of benefits and relief from reading a short novel and broaden his horizon by appreciating a nice poem. Many friends around me would believe reading and writing some effective ways to relax themselves.______e) Nearly all the jobs require people who can read and write very well. Even if one just plans to be a driver, he must read the road sign and know where he is and where he will go.​</a>

Question:
What were the feelings or emotions evoked and thoughts provoked in you as you listened or viewed the music videos?  
How do you think music and dance aid the African peoples in particular, and humanity in general, to express or communicate their aspirations, beliefs, struggles, values, fears, and problems in life?
One of the striking points of the text says: “Popular (African) music has been used as a vehicle to communicate the struggle against many forms of domination, including the struggle for equal rights and the struggles of workers and life in shantytowns surrounding big cities.” What can you deduce about the African character from this line? Explain.
What is the poem  “Africa’s Plea” all about?

A reader-response asks the reader to examine, explain and defend his/her personal reaction to a reading________2. Reader-response suggests that the role of the reader is essential to the meaning of a text or poetry, for only in the reading experience does the literary work come alive. ________ 3. When writing a reader-response, write as an educated adult addressing other adults or fellow scholars. ________ 4. There is no right or wrong answers to a reader-response. It is important that the critique should demonstrate his or her understanding of the text, book or reading and clearly explain their reactions with supporting details. ________5.. As a beginning scholar, if you write that something has nothing to do with you or does not pass your "Who cares?" test, but many other people think that it is important and great, readers will probably not agree with you that the text is dull or boring. ________6. Use limited quotes as examples of how it agrees with and supports what you think about the world, about right and wrong, and about what you think it is to be human.________7. As a beginning scholar, it is okay not to be cautious of criticizing any text or poem as "confusing" or "crazy," since readers might simply conclude that you are too ignorant or slow to understand and appreciate it.________8. Your "critique" can and should not be positive and not praise the text if possible, as well as pointing out problems, disagreements and shortcomings. ________9. Do NOT use quotes or examples to illustrate the quality of the text as art or entertainment.________ 10. In writing a response you may assume the reader has already read the text or poem. Thus, you can summarize the contents of the text at ength. Instead, take a systematic, analytical approach to the text.​</a>

                            16.  Rearrange the following paragraphs by labeling 1-5 to build a strong body of persuasive essay.______a) The main reason which may win most of people's support is that if lack the reading and writing ability, one would be considered as illiterate who has been deprived of the most basic right of human beings in the 21st century. ______b) The second reason I would like to point out is that people today who cannot read and write cannot even make a living. Good jobs are difficult to find because of economic depression.______c) It will be hard for us to imagine how somebody who can't read and write communicates with other people. A case in point is that one of my neighbors who is an old man and cannot read and write may only talk with others face to face. As for making friends by email and search information in newspaper, it is absolutely impossible. ______d) Furthermore, the ability to read and write could bring us lots of advantages. Suppose that people who have tired out with a hard week's sweat and effort may get lots of benefits and relief from reading a short novel and broaden his horizon by appreciating a nice poem. Many friends around me would believe reading and writing some effective ways to relax themselves.______e) Nearly all the jobs require people who can read and write very well. Even if one just plans to be a driver, he must read the road sign and know where he is and where he will go.​</h2><br />

Question:
What were the feelings or emotions evoked and thoughts provoked in you as you listened or viewed the music videos?  
How do you think music and dance aid the African peoples in particular, and humanity in general, to express or communicate their aspirations, beliefs, struggles, values, fears, and problems in life?
One of the striking points of the text says: “Popular (African) music has been used as a vehicle to communicate the struggle against many forms of domination, including the struggle for equal rights and the struggles of workers and life in shantytowns surrounding big cities.” What can you deduce about the African character from this line? Explain.

                            28. Read the poem “ caged bird”
1. What part of the poem strikes you the most and why?
2. What is the message of the poem about human rights/human freedom?
3. Write/compose a short poem about Human Rights (English/Filipino/Bicol):</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. One part of the poem "Caged Bird" that strikes me the most is the line "The caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still." This line conveys the idea that despite being confined, the bird still has a desire for freedom and feels a longing for something beyond its current circumstances.</p><p></p><p>2. The message of the poem about human rights/human freedom is about the struggle for equality and justice. The caged bird symbolizes those who are oppressed and denied their basic rights and freedoms, while the free bird represents those who have the privilege and ability to live freely.
