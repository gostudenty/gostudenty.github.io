Bread - If Lyrics​If a picture paints a thousand words Then why can't I paint you?The words 	never show The youI've come to knowIf a face could launch a thousand ships Then where am I to go?There's no one home but youYou're all that's left me tooAnd when my love for life is running dry You come and pour yourself on meIf a man could be two places at one timeI'd be with youTomorrow and todayBeside you all the wayIf the world should stop revolvingSpinning slowly down to dieI'd spend the end 	youAnd when the world was throughThen one by one the stars would all go outThen you and I would simply fly away1 John 3:17But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?​</a>
