One of America’s gifts to us is efficiency, the scientific coordination of planning and action, the philosophy of correct and timely execution. Though long schooled in our Oriental disrespect for Time and encouraged, though unwittingly, to expect the Will that causes the palay to grow to also do our work for us, we realize at last that Time is an element to reckon with, that life here and now, being spread thinly over a limited period of years, must be economized and put to some profitable use. 
Our special significance is this realization in the economic life of our people. The bureaucratic system has impressed upon most of us that we must observe punctuality or lose out; that out pay envelop comes to many of us during stated periods of the month and not before or after, although we may spend its content in advance; and that our efficiency of times detrmine our income.</a>

Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</a>

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</a>

                                            They had moved here to the island of Mindoro about a year ago because Julio had been unable to find any land of his own to farm. As it was, he thought himself lucky when Ka Ponso agreed to take him on as a tenant. “Dear Compadre,” he started writing. A while before, his wife had given birth to a baby. Ka Ponso had happened to be in the neighborhood and offered to be the baby’s godfather. After that they had begun to call each other compadre. Julio was writing in Tagalog, bending earnestly over a piece of paper torn out of his son’s school notebook. It was many months since he had had a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the municipal office in Mansalay to file a homestead application. Then he had used a pen and, to his surprise, he had been able to fill in the blank form neatly. Nothing had come of the application, although Ka Ponso had assured him he had looked into the matter and talked with the officials concerned. Now, using a pencil instead of a pen, Julio was sure he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso. Answer the following questions based on the text. 1. Who had moved to the island of Mindoro? 2. Why did they move to the island? 3. How did Ka Ponso help him? 4. How are Ka Ponso and Julio related to each other? 5. What was it that Julio was happy about? 6. What positive characteristics did Julio show in the story? Did you admire him for that? Why, explain your answer.</a>

                                            read it allWhy the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​</a>

Hello, my name is Frances Gracy H. Beslig and today I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo . First of all before I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo, I will tell you the different kinds of organism that is found in our front yard: Ants or langgam in tagalog ,birds or ibon, snail or kuhol, and little frogs or maliliit na mga palaka. So moving on I will show you the ingredients we need.
So we need oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, pepper, pork, and soy sauce with onions and calamansi for dipping. After that we have to wash the utensils we need like plates. So the procedure is to: 
• Preheat the air fryer to 400°F. 
• In a large bowl, combine the oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. 
• Next, add the pork belly pieces to the oil mixture to coat each piece. 
• Then, in a single layer, place the pork belly cubes in the air fryer basket. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook them in batches. 
Cook the pork belly bites for 20 minutes, shaking and flipping them a couple of times throughout the air-frying time. You can always cook them longer if you want them crispier or more done. 
• Remove the bites from the air fryer and serve warm.</a>

                                            would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</a>

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the 
woman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation.

Samakatuwid, nananalangin ako sa Iyo, maawa ka sa akin, at patawarin ang aking mga paglabag, kusang-loob at hindi sinasadya, sa salita at sa gawa, kilala at hindi alam.

Nagpapasalamat ako sa Inyo na binigyan Mo ako, na hindi karapat-dapat sa akin, upang makibahagi sa Iyong dalisay at makalangit na Regalo.
Ngunit, O Panginoon, Mahilig sa mga tao, Na namatay para sa amin at muling bumangon at iginawad sa amin ang Iyong kinakatakutan at nagbibigay ng buhay na mga Misteryo para sa ikabubuti at pagpapakabanal ng aming mga kaluluwa at katawan, bigyan mo ito marahil kahit na sa akin para sa paggaling ng aking kaluluwa at katawan, para sa pag-iwas sa lahat ng pagalit, para sa pag-iilaw ng mga mata ng aking puso, para sa kapayapaan ng mga kapangyarihan ng aking kaluluwa, para sa walang kahihiyang pananampalataya, para sa taos-pusong pag-ibig, para sa kaganapan ng karunungan, para sa pagsunod sa Iyong mga utos, para sa isang pagtaas ng Iyong banal na biyaya, at para sa pamilyar sa Iyong Kaharian; upang mapanatili Ko sila sa Iyong kabanalan maalala ko ang Iyong biyaya, at hindi mabuhay para sa aking sarili ngunit para sa Iyo ng aming Panginoon at Makinabang. At sa gayon kapag lumipas na ako mula sa pag-iral dito sa pag-asang buhay na walang hanggan, makamit ko sana ang walang hanggang kapahingahan, kung saan ang kanta ay walang tigil sa mga nag-iingat ng piyesta at ang kagalakan ay walang hanggan sa mga nakakakita sa hindi mabuting kagandahan ng Iyong mukha.

One of America’s gifts to us is efficiency, the scientific coordination of planning and action, the philosophy of correct and timely execution. Though long schooled in our Oriental disrespect for Time and encouraged, though unwittingly, to expect the Will that causes the palay to grow to also do our work for us, we realize at last that Time is an element to reckon with, that life here and now, being spread thinly over a limited period of years, must be economized and put to some profitable use. 
Our special significance is this realization in the economic life of our people. The bureaucratic system has impressed upon most of us that we must observe punctuality or lose out; that out pay envelop comes to many of us during stated periods of the month and not before or after, although we may spend its content in advance; and that our efficiency of times detrmine our income.</h2><br />

Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</h2><br />

                            9. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</h2><br />

Julio was writing in Tagalog, bending earnestly over a piece of paper torn out of his son’s school notebook. It was many months since he had had a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the municipal office in Mansalay to file a homestead application. Then he had used a pen and, to his surprise, he had been able to fill in the blank form neatly. Nothing had come of the application, although Ka Ponso had assured him he had looked into the matter and talked with the officials concerned. Now, using a pencil instead of a pen, Julio was sure he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso. Answer the following questions based on the text. 1. Who had moved to the island of Mindoro? 2. Why did they move to the island? 3. How did Ka Ponso help him? 4. How are Ka Ponso and Julio related to each other? 5. What was it that Julio was happy about? 6. What positive characteristics did Julio show in the story? Did you admire him for that? Why, explain your answer.</h2><br />

                            18. read it allWhy the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​</h2><br />

Hello, my name is Frances Gracy H. Beslig and today I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo . First of all before I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo, I will tell you the different kinds of organism that is found in our front yard: Ants or langgam in tagalog ,birds or ibon, snail or kuhol, and little frogs or maliliit na mga palaka. So moving on I will show you the ingredients we need.
So we need oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, pepper, pork, and soy sauce with onions and calamansi for dipping. After that we have to wash the utensils we need like plates. So the procedure is to: 
• Preheat the air fryer to 400°F. 
• In a large bowl, combine the oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. 
• Next, add the pork belly pieces to the oil mixture to coat each piece. 
• Then, in a single layer, place the pork belly cubes in the air fryer basket. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook them in batches. 
Cook the pork belly bites for 20 minutes, shaking and flipping them a couple of times throughout the air-frying time. You can always cook them longer if you want them crispier or more done. 
• Remove the bites from the air fryer and serve warm.</h2><br />

                            24. would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</h2><br />
