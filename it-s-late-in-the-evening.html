                                            Name Grade ENGLISH S Section Quarter: 1 Week: 2 LAS No. 2 MELC(s: 1 distinguish compound from complex sentences. 2 compose compound and complex sentences using dependent and independent clauses, 3. compose clear and coherent sentences using coordinate and subordinate conjunctions. There are two types of clauses in a sentence. Independent clause or simple sentence can stand alone as a complete sentence. It has a subject and verb, and it stands by itself as a complete idea. The other kind of clause is dependent clause These are not complete sentences, but they do contain a noun and a verb. It cannot stand alone. It needs more information to complete the thought. If two independent clauses are combined, it forms compound sentences. When these clauses are joined. they need a coordinating conjunction between them. Coordinating conjunctions include the following words: for, and, nor, but, or. yet, so. There are seven and you can remember them using the acronym FANBOYS. When a dependent clause is joined to an independent clause, it forms a complex sentence. It needs subordinating conjunctions such as because, since, so that, if, unless, whether than, although even though, after, until whenever, where, wherever, or a relative pronoun such as that, who, or which. Answer: Though he was late Direction: Read each sentence below. Encircle the independent clause and box the dependent or subordinate clause. Example: Though he was late, he still made a contribution. he still made a contribution. 1. After the 14-day quarantine, he was issued a certificate of completion. 2. Unless she reports it, she will be the missing link in the contact tracing. 3. Even though they finished the quarantine, they will still have to follow the health restrictions. 4. We went to the health office since laboratory tests were required. 5. Whenever you are ready, you need to let me know. 6. Wherever you are, I will find you. 7. Before the enhanced community quarantine, my mother bought basic food and medical supplies. 8. If my sister fails, I will be the one to blame. 9. Because of the pandemic, children and senior citizens are restricted to go out of their homes. 10. As one of the frontliners during this pandemic, doctors and nurses risk themselves just to provide healthcare services.​</a>

"How come she died so soon when she is still 95 years old", she wondered. Tina was crying a river. If only she could keep her pain and sadness inside a jar and let it sink underwater. Life is really fair for taking her beloved grandmother away. How she wished her grandma was given a thousand years to live.â€‹ 1 SEE ANSWER Log in to add comment Answer 5.0/5 1 darangthea Ambitious 13 answers 220 people helped Answer: need point s lang po Explanation: sorry kattyahto8 and 2 more users found this answer helpful THANKS 1 5.0 (1 vote) 10 mabalatan13649015020 avatar report nyo yes deserve mo ma banned because brainly is for answer of all question not for sorry sorry tas ang kapal pa ng mukha mong mag pa follow FranzAgustinnnnn avatar pa follow panga normamacalaba avatar reporttt SEE MORE COMMENTS Log in to add comment Still have questions?

STRESSDo you think that stress is always something negative? Actually, stress can either be negative or positive!STRESS is defined as the physiological (or physical) and emotional responses to a significant or unexpected change or disruption in one’s life (Payne, et al., 2005).It may also refer to “what you feel when you react to pressure, either from the outside world (school, family, friends) or from yourself i.e. wanting to do fit in, wanting to do well in school.The word STRESSOR refers to the things that make a person stressed. There are two different kinds of stress – eustress and distress.EUSTRESS refers to a positive and healthy response of the body from a stressor. It produces good effects to one’s well-being. For example, a person, who studied for long hours then took and got an outstanding grade in the exam, may feel happiness and enjoyment.On the other hand, DISTRESS refers to negative reaction of the body towards a given stressor. It may cause problems in health, alter the mood and emotions, and even affect the way a person thinks. For example, when a person woke up late for work, he or she may feel anger and disappointment.Lesson 1STRESSWhat I KnowP__ __S__C__LE__V__ __ __NM __N __ __LE__ __T__ __N__LM__R__L - S __ __R __ __ __ __LM__ __T__LS__ C__ __​</a>

                            6. Name Grade ENGLISH S Section Quarter: 1 Week: 2 LAS No. 2 MELC(s: 1 distinguish compound from complex sentences. 2 compose compound and complex sentences using dependent and independent clauses, 3. compose clear and coherent sentences using coordinate and subordinate conjunctions. There are two types of clauses in a sentence. Independent clause or simple sentence can stand alone as a complete sentence. It has a subject and verb, and it stands by itself as a complete idea. The other kind of clause is dependent clause These are not complete sentences, but they do contain a noun and a verb. It cannot stand alone. It needs more information to complete the thought. If two independent clauses are combined, it forms compound sentences. When these clauses are joined. they need a coordinating conjunction between them. Coordinating conjunctions include the following words: for, and, nor, but, or. yet, so. There are seven and you can remember them using the acronym FANBOYS. When a dependent clause is joined to an independent clause, it forms a complex sentence. It needs subordinating conjunctions such as because, since, so that, if, unless, whether than, although even though, after, until whenever, where, wherever, or a relative pronoun such as that, who, or which. Answer: Though he was late Direction: Read each sentence below. Encircle the independent clause and box the dependent or subordinate clause. Example: Though he was late, he still made a contribution. he still made a contribution. 1. After the 14-day quarantine, he was issued a certificate of completion. 2. Unless she reports it, she will be the missing link in the contact tracing. 3. Even though they finished the quarantine, they will still have to follow the health restrictions. 4. We went to the health office since laboratory tests were required. 5. Whenever you are ready, you need to let me know. 6. Wherever you are, I will find you. 7. Before the enhanced community quarantine, my mother bought basic food and medical supplies. 8. If my sister fails, I will be the one to blame. 9. Because of the pandemic, children and senior citizens are restricted to go out of their homes. 10. As one of the frontliners during this pandemic, doctors and nurses risk themselves just to provide healthcare services.​</h2><br />

STRESSDo you think that stress is always something negative? Actually, stress can either be negative or positive!STRESS is defined as the physiological (or physical) and emotional responses to a significant or unexpected change or disruption in one’s life (Payne, et al., 2005).It may also refer to “what you feel when you react to pressure, either from the outside world (school, family, friends) or from yourself i.e. wanting to do fit in, wanting to do well in school.The word STRESSOR refers to the things that make a person stressed. There are two different kinds of stress – eustress and distress.EUSTRESS refers to a positive and healthy response of the body from a stressor. It produces good effects to one’s well-being. For example, a person, who studied for long hours then took and got an outstanding grade in the exam, may feel happiness and enjoyment.On the other hand, DISTRESS refers to negative reaction of the body towards a given stressor. It may cause problems in health, alter the mood and emotions, and even affect the way a person thinks. For example, when a person woke up late for work, he or she may feel anger and disappointment.Lesson 1STRESSWhat I KnowP__ __S__C__LE__V__ __ __NM __N __ __LE__ __T__ __N__LM__R__L - S __ __R __ __ __ __LM__ __T__LS__ C__ __​</h2><br />
