Actually, the Paombong word was derived from bumbong (a container made of bamboo). The old way of fermenting the vinegar (suka) was through this container. Sukang Paombong is one of the well-known products of Bulacan. Paombong has a vast plantation of sasâ or nipa palm. This plant is usually found along the estuary where salt water and fresh water flow. From its matured (bungang sasa) nipa palm fruits, these fruits are being spurned for one week to produce more juice and it is locally termed as pagsikad. First, tuba gatherers (manunubâ) used sharp knife to grate the end bent of the sasâ branch. Second, a bumbong will be used as the container of the sasâ juice when it comes out. Next, gathered sasâ juice will be transferred into a large container called "tapayan" (earthen jar) after two or three weeks of that process. Then, they will use a strainer to eliminate the dregs from the juice. Finally, after weeks of fermenting the vinegar in the container, sukang Paombong will be tasted and now is ready to be arranged right in your dining table.Tittle__________Author___________Setting___________Characters___________Event/s__________Theme_________nonsense report​</a>

So, what are we waiting for? Let's go and invite him now to join us! lunch, Andrew eagerly asked. All together, the three of them approached Jose and greeted him, would you like to join us for lunch? Jose was so surprised that he was not able to reply at once. After a couple of seconds, he smiled and said, Oh, hi! Are you really inviting me for lunch? Jose timidly asked? " Yes, we are inviting you for lunch, "the three boys replied in unison. " Oh, yes, I would like to join!" Jose immediately replied. From then on Jose became happy as he was frequently invited by the three boys to join the group. They became friends, and they all played and ate together.1. Who was the transferee in grade four?2.

Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature.

                            14.                       A Sour Process                  Jon-Jon Surio Reyes Suka is the tagalog term for vinegar and Paombong is a place in Bulacan where earlier Spaniards named the town because of its huge area planted with bamboo. Actually, the Paombong word was derived from bumbong (a container made of bamboo). The old way of fermenting the vinegar (suka) was through this container. Sukang Paombong is one of the well-known products of Bulacan. Paombong has a vast plantation of sasâ or nipa palm. This plant is usually found along the estuary where salt water and fresh water flow. From its matured (bungang sasa) nipa palm fruits, these fruits are being spurned for one week to produce more juice and it is locally termed as pagsikad. First, tuba gatherers (manunubâ) used sharp knife to grate the end bent of the sasâ branch. Second, a bumbong will be used as the container of the sasâ juice when it comes out. Next, gathered sasâ juice will be transferred into a large container called "tapayan" (earthen jar) after two or three weeks of that process. Then, they will use a strainer to eliminate the dregs from the juice. Finally, after weeks of fermenting the vinegar in the container, sukang Paombong will be tasted and now is ready to be arranged right in your dining table.Tittle__________Author___________Setting___________Characters___________Event/s__________Theme_________nonsense report​</h2><br />

He may not understand us in invite him to join our group." Paolo immediately replied. He may not enjoy the same thing that we enjoy as Manileños, Miguel, another classmate of Andrew, added. Wel, you are both right," Andrew said. But I think we should not ignore him just becaus he is different from us. I do not think it is right to judge him before we even try to ma friends with him. So, what are we waiting for? Let's go and invite him now to join us! lunch, Andrew eagerly asked. All together, the three of them approached Jose and greeted him, would you like to join us for lunch? Jose was so surprised that he was not able to reply at once. After a couple of seconds, he smiled and said, Oh, hi! Are you really inviting me for lunch? Jose timidly asked? " Yes, we are inviting you for lunch, "the three boys replied in unison. " Oh, yes, I would like to join!" Jose immediately replied.

An initial 55,000 poor households affected by COVID-19 will receive a bag of rice, and canned goods from ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project. ADB has launched an emergency food provision program on 31 March, following the approval of the $5 million Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision technical assistance program. The grant is implemented under the Tagalog name Bayan Bayanihan, the well-known Filipino principle of sharing what one has with one's community.The program provides for essential food supplies to around 55,000 of the most vulnerable households in the National Capital Region and neighboring areas, affected by income losses for daily wage earners due to the enhanced quarantine to contain COVID-19. It will act as a 'bridge' support until ADB's large-scale cash transfer program is rolled out. The program has a collaboration platform to attract private sector and philanthropic contributions for its expansion.1. What is the newsflash about?2.

Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature. TRANSFERAfter listening to the audio sample provided, try to answer the following questions. 1. What do you notice about the melody? What instrument played it? 2. How about the mood of the pieces? How can you say that it shows a happy mood, a sad mood, a relax mood, a playful mood, a patriotic mood? 3. Suppose all the instruments will only play the melody of the piece, what do you think will be your general impression about the piece? 4. How does the dynamics of the piece affect its overall sound? Which is better, a piece with dynamics or without dynamics? Why? 5. If ever you will choose your rondalla instrument, what will it be? Why? 6.
