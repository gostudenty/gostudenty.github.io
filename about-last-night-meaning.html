"I got a flower" by Paulette kelly
It wasn’t my birthday or any other special day.
We had our first argument last night.
He said a lot of cruel things that really hurt me.
I know he was sorry and didn’t mean the things he said.
Because I got flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t our anniversary or any other special day.
Last night, he threw me into a wall and started to choke me.
It seemed like a nightmare. I couldn’t believe it was real.
I woke up this morning sore and bruised all over. I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t Valentine’s Day or any other special day.
Last night, he beat me up again.
And it was much worse than all other times.

"I got a flower" by Paulette kelly
It wasn’t my birthday or any other special day.
We had our first argument last night.
He said a lot of cruel things that really hurt me.
I know he was sorry and didn’t mean the things he said.
Because I got flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t our anniversary or any other special day.
Last night, he threw me into a wall and started to choke me.
It seemed like a nightmare. I couldn’t believe it was real.
I woke up this morning sore and bruised all over. I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t Valentine’s Day or any other special day.
Last night, he beat me up again.
And it was much worse than all other times.
If I leave him, what will I do? How will I take care of my kids? What about money? I’m afraid of him and scared to leave. But I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
Today was a very special day. It was the day of my funeral. Last night he finally killed me. He beat me to death.</h2><br />

I was about approaching her when i saw him at the balcony with a big stick. Oh!they are at it again!"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A) Inference:Linguistic Cues: In the first piece of discourse, Kemi's use of the phrase "true character" implies that the person she was in courtship with was not behaving in a way that was expected of him. In the second piece of discourse, Segun's use of the phrase "best footballer" and Akin's response can be interpreted as Segun making an overconfident claim that is contradicted by the results of his performance. In the third piece of discourse, the narrator's description of "fear written all over her" and the sight of the person with a "big stick" implies that the woman is in danger.Contextual Cues: The contextual cues for the first piece of discourse are the conversation between Kemi and Bimpe, which suggests that Bimpe is considering marriage and is asking Kemi for advice. The contextual cues for the second piece of discourse are the mention of a penalty kick and the results of Segun's performance, which suggests that Segun is boasting about his skills despite his failure in the penalty kick. The contextual cues for the third piece of discourse are the narrator's observation of the woman running in fear and the person with a big stick, which suggests that the woman is in an abusive relationship.<strong>a</strong>) Kemi is implying that Bimpe should not marry the person Kemi was in a relationship with because Kemi knows their true character. This is inferred from Kemi's statement about quitting the relationship because of the person's true character and Bimpe's response asking if Kemi is saying she shouldn't marry the person.<strong>b</strong>) Akin is implying that Segun is not the best footballer in the team because of the penalty kick he lost last night. This is inferred from Segun's statement about being the best footballer and Akin's response mentioning the penalty kick.<strong>c</strong>) The speaker is implying that the person they saw running across the road is in danger because the speaker saw fear on their face and someone else with a weapon on the balcony. This is inferred from the description of the person running across the road with fear and the mention of someone else with a weapon on the balcony.___________________________<p><strong>Have </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>great </strong><strong>day</strong><strong>!</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
