Epistle from Mother Earth
by Maricon V. Estrellado
Four billions of years ago, when i was born in the midst of the vast blanket of the unknown, I was really gung-ho when human babies were born to make me as their beloved home. 
My oceans are like gigantic rucksacks of foods, goods and treasures for your pleasures. 
My trees extend their canopies bearing fruits and giving comfy shades for your siestas amd rests. 
My highland-spots near the outstretched curtains of bluish sky become your rendezvous of socialization and a series of "hi" I became an aficionado of anthropology as I witness how you adapt and evolve through these years. There just something that bothers me, an appeal of mutualism between you and me. 
Can you be aficionados of environmentalism too?

Epistle from Mother Earth
by Maricon V. Estrellado
Four billions of years ago, when i was born in the midst of the vast blanket of the unknown, I was really gung-ho when human babies were born to make me as their beloved home. 
My oceans are like gigantic rucksacks of foods, goods and treasures for your pleasures. 
My trees extend their canopies bearing fruits and giving comfy shades for your siestas amd rests. 
My highland-spots near the outstretched curtains of bluish sky become your rendezvous of socialization and a series of "hi" I became an aficionado of anthropology as I witness how you adapt and evolve through these years. There just something that bothers me, an appeal of mutualism between you and me. 
Can you be aficionados of environmentalism too?
