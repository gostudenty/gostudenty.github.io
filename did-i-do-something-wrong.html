This time, let us apply the knowledge that you have learned in real life situation. This is done for you to appreciate the relationship between the lesson learned and the life that we all shared here on earth. This task is quite timely. Simply because, it has something to do with the situation that everybody is in when the COVID-19 pandemic strikes, our country. The diagram below shows a COVID-19 virus injecting its viral materials into the nucleus of the cell. Your task is to predict its effect on the function of each organelle identified below. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper.Right answer☑️Wrong answer❌ I report​</h2><br />
                        <strong></strong><strong>Effects of COVID-19 Virus to The Organelles of The Cell</strong><p></p><p><strong>NUCLEUS </strong>- the virus prevents cellular mRNA from getting out of the nucleus, including instructions for proteins meant to alert the immune system to infection. Because gene transcripts can’t get out of the nucleus, the infected cells don’t release many interferons — these are signalling proteins that alert the immune system to the presence of a virus.</p><p></p><p><strong>CELL MEMBRANE</strong> - First, some of the newly made viral spike proteins travel to the surface of the cell and poke out of the host-cell membrane. There, they activate a host calcium-ion channel, which expels a fatty coating onto the outside of the cell — the same coating found on cells that naturally fuse together, such as muscle cells. At this point, the infected cell fuses to neighbouring cells expressing ACE2, developing into massive individual respiratory cells filled with up to 20 nuclei.</p><p></p><p><strong>ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM </strong>- On the inside of the cell, even more change is occurring. Like other coronaviruses, COVID-19 transforms the long, thin endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a network of flat membranes involved in protein synthesis and transport, into double-membrane spheres, as if the ER were blowing bubbles. These double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) might provide a safe place for viral RNA to be replicated and translated, shielding it from innate immune sensors in the cell, but that hypothesis is still being investigated.</p><p></p><p><strong>GOLGI BODY</strong> - For years, evidence has suggested that coronaviruses are transported out of the cell through the Golgi complex, an organelle that works like a post office, packaging molecules in membranes and sending them off to other parts of the cell. There, the virus forms a lipid envelope from the Golgi complex’s membrane; newly formed virions are then carried inside Golgi vesicles to the cell surface.</p><p></p><p><strong>MITOCHINDRION </strong>- Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 highjacks mitochondria of immune cells, replicates within mitochondrial structures, and impairs mitochondrial dynamics leading to cell death. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell and are largely involved in maintaining cell immunity, homeostasis, and cell survival/death.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>#Brainly</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />
